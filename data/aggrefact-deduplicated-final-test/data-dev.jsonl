The young Spaniard scored his second Premier League goal , cutting inside and curling left - footed past Simon Mignolet , in the 4 - 1 win over Liverpool last weekend , and is developing a reputation as a player capable of becoming a top - level full back . But , it seems , in the dressing room , it is his status as the club ' s premier sprinter , rather than as a defender , that is most in question , after he beat Theo Walcott ' s 40 metre club sprint record last summer . Hector Bellerin scored a brilliant goal to put Arsenal ahead against Liverpool last weekend at the Emirates . Bellerin has emerged as a star player after filling in for the injured Mathieu Debuchy at right back this season . ' We were just having a test and then they told me I was the fastest at the club , ' Bellerin told The Telegraph . ' I did not beat it by that much . There was a bit of banter and he is trying to beat me now . ' Bellerin shaved a hundredth of a second off Walcott ' s time , prompting the 26 - year - old winger to vow to reclaim his title at the end of the season . . And since then he has gone on to establish himself as a right - back of some promise , progressing well beyond Arsene Wenger ' s expectations . . ' I am happy that now , after not so good performances in the beginning , the coach has still put confidence in me and given me minutes . . Bellerin has exceptional pace , as he proved in August when he set a new Arsenal record over 40 metres . Theo Walcott had previously held the record , but Bellerin shaved one hundredth of a second off his time . But Walcott is determined to take his record back from Bellerin this summer and be speed king again . ' The chances always come through injuries , which is not a nice thing .

Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al - Khalifa , who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies . They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust .

But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family , including the US - and UK - educated Crown Prince Salman , who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country ' s Shia majority . Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co - operation Council ( GCC ) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011 , the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven - point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy . \" We had an agreement with the crown prince , \" he said . \" The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later , GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue . \" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state , Sheikh Salman said he was \" hopeful \" that he would \" do more than his predecessor \" , Hillary Clinton . \" US policy needs to be more clear and direct .

The 57 - year - old has criticised the ' absolutely ridiculous ' investigation after he was told he will face no further action .

{"dataset": "frank", "origin": "cnndm", "id": "2beb3c90dd9c2fe8288f352b6b973b5a0b5dd0dc", "doc": "( CNN ) ESPN ' s Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news , rather than reporting on it , after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington , Virginia . Among the highlights , as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak : \" I ' m on television and you ' re in a f * * king trailer , honey , \" and \" I wouldn ' t work at a scumbag place like this . Makes my skin crawl even being here . \" And , finally , \" Lose some weight , baby girl . \" It ' s pretty cringe - worthy stuff that seems difficult , if not impossible , to defend . McHenry quickly issued an apology , blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility . It was , however , too late : the # firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter , where she was called everything from classist , class - less , and \" ugly on the inside \" to a \" sad , self - hating coward . \" ESPN , meanwhile , announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week . Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that ' s what she was thinking , least of all because in our YouTube age , such missteps always come to light . But while McHenry ' s reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what ' s also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing - - or , it seems , caring about - - the other side of the story . The video that was released - - by the tow company - - was heavily edited and included only McHenry ' s responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on .

The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years . \" They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently . \" If they can sell high - value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people , then that is certainly something they should look at . \" But Labour said the coalition ' s \" failed \" polices were \" making the housing crisis worse not better \" . Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said : \" Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes , breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods . \" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250 , 000 affordable homes and \" put unemployed builders back to work \" and boost the construction industry .

No bombs were found at any of the centres targeted with telephone calls . Last week , 27 Jewish community centres in 17 US states reported receiving hoax bomb threats . All of the threats made on Monday , along with previous incidents in January , turned out to be false and Jewish centres have since reopened with normal services resumed . Responding to the latest incidents , White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that US President Donald Trump had made it \" abundantly clear \" that such actions were \" unacceptable \" . \" Hatred and hate - motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom , \" the statement , which was shared on Twitter by NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander , said . Mr Trump ' s daughter Ivanka - who has converted to Judaism and whose husband is Jewish - also condemned the threats . Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that action must be taken to prevent further incidents . In a post on Twitter , Mrs Clinton wrote : \" JCC threats , cemetery desecration and online attacks are so troubling and they need to be stopped . Everyone must speak out , starting w / @ POTUS . \" The threats were made to the Jewish community centres through calls that were both pre - recorded and live , with suspects using voice - disguising technology , according to Israeli newspaper Haaretz . Since the beginning of the year , there have been reports of threats to centres in New York , New Jersey , Ohio , Florida , Massachusetts , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , Delaware , Connecticut , Alabama , California , Maine , Tennessee , South Carolina , Missouri , Wisconsin , Texas and Kansas . The JCC Association of North America , a network of health and education centres , has since been reviewing its security plans . In an earlier statement the FBI said that along with the US justice department it was investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with the threats .

But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle , and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012 / 13 .

But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right - footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards . Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20 - yard free - kick into the top corner .

Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non - existent crime . Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday . He will be sentenced next week . Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene , prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings . He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary . The threats were made on two occasions , late at night , while Hughes was drunk . Judge Niclas Parry , who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009 , remanded him in custody pending sentence .

Park View Educational Trust said it may be removed from running the schools .

A head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools said parents tried to undermine her authority and descended on the school during an Ofsted inspection . The head teacher , who wished to remain anonymous , said she heard parents speaking to an inspector about her . She said she came close to quitting her job on a number of occasions but everything \" fell into place \" when news of the Trojan Horse letter broke . \" From 2012 I felt alone , \" she said . \" I did not know it was happening to other heads . If I had known , I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed . \" I started thinking ' maybe it is me , maybe I ' m doing something wrong . ' \" On Monday , the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover . Five of those schools , including Park View and Oldknow , were rated inadequate . ' Islamic - themed assemblies ' Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School , the only local authority school placed in special measures , and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board . In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam , education minister Lord Nash said there were \" deep concerns \" about the way Park View School was run . The letter said : \" I have decided under clause 5 . 6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State ' s intention to terminate that agreement . \" Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote \" spiritual , moral , social and cultural development of pupils \" . \" I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination , advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations , \" he said . A similar letter about Nansen Primary School , also addressed to Tahir Alam , said it would have its funding arrangement terminated . Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July . A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels . They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools . \" What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "30216408", "doc": "But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices . The study , commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools , looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools . Many pupils reported that they took an internet - connected device to bed to continue social media conversations . The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home . Tablets are now being used , at least to some extent , in 68 % of primary and 69 % of secondary schools , according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family , Kids and Youth research group . But researchers found examples of much more intensive use . In 9 % of schools , there was an individual tablet device for every pupil . The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools . The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present , 45 % reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them . Between 2014 and 2016 , the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430 , 000 to almost 900 , 000 . But Dr Clarke , formerly of the University of Cambridge ' s education department , says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results . Researchers can not isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment . But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact . And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families . Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools . \" The type of device might change , but it ' s not going to go away . It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology , \" she said . A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson , published on Monday , suggested that touch - screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read . It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch - screen computers rather than printed books . The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people . Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer , a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet \" addicts \" .

A team of cancer specialists , GPs , NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact - finding visit to Aarhus , Denmark ' s second city . So what was the problem ? Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed \" quite alarming \" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries , including the rest of Scandinavia . Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long . It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms . They could be fast - tracked to specialists in hospital . It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out . \" We looked at 30 , 000 cancer cases - and more than 25 % of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn ' t think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it ' s important to find those cases , \" said Prof Olesen . What were the changes ? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes . First - for patients with \" alarm \" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast - track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets . In addition to that , by law , any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral . Second , the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs can not diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them , whether it is cancer or something else . GP Dr Hanne Heje , who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer . It also stops the \" ping pong \" between GPs and different specialists . \" Now we know there ' s a department meeting the patient with open arms saying ' we welcome you ' , even though there ' s not a diagnosis written on their forehead , \" she said .

Homes with the upmarket store nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £ 38 , 831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren ’ t near a branch . But having a budget store such as an Aldi or Lidl on your doorstep means your house could be worth thousands of pounds less than others in your neighbourhood . Homes with a Waitrose nearby cost 12 per cent more – or £ 38 , 831 – than those in surrounding areas that weren ’ t near a branch . But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less In a study published today , Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby , to see how they compared to the wider postal region . Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of £ 354 , 378 – which was £ 38 , 831 ( 12 per cent ) more than typical prices for their regions .

This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12 - month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago . As of 31 March 2016 , only one case of homicide recorded in 2015 - 16 was unresolved . The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51 % of homicides ( 29 cases ) in 2015 - 16 . Nearly all of these cases ( 26 out of 29 ) involved a knife . While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs , 31 % ( 20 people ) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs . Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said : \" While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long - term decline in violent crime , the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue , because each of the lives lost is one life too many . \" There is a clear role across a range of public services , in addition to the critical work of our police , to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so - called ' casual ' violence . \" We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime , while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others . \" Scottish Labour ' s justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said : \" Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution . \" Last year when the Scottish government were heralding ' record low ' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop , the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase . \" Meanwhile , sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45 - year high and in the past year we

A new generation of suncreams promise to protect against the damage from infra - red A rays and others say they protect the skin from the inside .

EXPERT VERDICT : ' A bit of a gimmick - the concept is you are protecting the skin from the inside out with antioxidants found in fruit and vegetables . ' There ' s no evidence that drinking this would stop sun damage . ' The suncream is ok , but it ' s pretty standard .

And on Sunday , in his national radio address to the nation , he said Indians needed to \" wipe the tears of every Nepali , hold their hands , and stand with them . \" It all highlights the more proactive role taken by India in recent months . Just weeks ago , India flexed its military muscle to rescue Indians and other nationals from conflict - torn Yemen . Now , it is taking the lead in Nepal .

Monsour Alshammari , 27 , was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego . He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February . Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape , a first - degree felony , and obstructing justice , a second - degree felony . He has not yet entered a plea to those charges . Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $ 100 , 000 someone posted for his bail . He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah . Orem police Lt . Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks . Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $ 100 , 000 bail mean he ' ll flee the country to avoid prosecution .

The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University . He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26 , but $ 100 , 000 in bail was posted for him five days later . Alshammari ' s attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday , saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest . .

Referee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left . There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner . Analysis : MOTD2 pundits on referee ' s ' mind - boggling inconsistencies ' Substitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester ' s run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes ' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left - footed finish two minutes later . As the game went into injury time , Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp . West Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour , but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend ' s home game with Swansea . Relive the action from the King Power Stadium Leicester ' s fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end . Psychologically , this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday . It means Leicester ' s last Premier League defeat is still that last - minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine ' s Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty - handed . Referee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle . Moss ' s eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna . Having already given Vardy a yellow card , he felt obliged to give a second . Vardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment .

Scroll down for video Incredibly lifelike : Known as Ham , this humanoid is made using specialised software and can recognise and respond to facial expressions Ham is currently on exhibit at the Global Sources spring electronics show at AsiaWorld Expo - the largest event of its kind in the world , with more than 4 , 000 booths displaying the latest gadgets . The head is created with malleable material called Frubber using soft - bodied mechanical engineering and nanotechnology . It contains realistic pores that measure just 4 to 40 nanometers across ( there are 10million nanometers in one centimetre ) . Using specialised software the machine can recognise and respond to a number of human facial expressions in a natural way . According to Hanson Robotics ' s website , the humanoids can actually see your face , make eye contact with you , and understand speech to ' engage you in witty dialogue ' . Such reactions are a major feat of engineering , according to chief designer David Hanson , the founder and and president of Hanson Robotics .

Down : RBS reposted a £ 446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US , the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis - sold payment protection insurance and fee - paying packaged accounts in the UK . RBS was also hit with a £ 453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US . The loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne , six days before the General Election . A return to profit for both RBS and state - backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008 . Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector , but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the £ 46billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis . Disgraced former RBS boss Fred Goodwin ( pictured ) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair . Mr Goodwin was knighted for ‘ services to banking ’ in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said : ‘ This is going to be another tough year . There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon . We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues . ’ The latest news wiped more than £ 700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338 . The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power . The disgraced former boss of RBS , Fred Goodwin , was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown .", "summ": "rbs reposted a £ 446million loss in the first three months

Philippa Charles , director of the Garfield Weston Foundation , said : \" The Garfield Weston Foundation supports organisations and activities that share a commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of the communities in which they work , and that are driven by a desire to achieve excellence . \" The Glasgow School of Art sits at the heart of the Garnethill community and the people of Glasgow hold the Mackintosh building dear . \" We are delighted to be able to support the Mackintosh Campus Appeal which will enable the GSA to bring this iconic building back as part an extended campus and enable the internationally - renowned Glasgow School of Art to recover fully from the impact of the fire . \" The art school announced earlier this year plans to purchase the former Stow College building in nearby West Campbell Street for its expanded Garnethill campus . The aim is to provide additional space to accommodate a 25 % increase in student numbers by 2018 . News of the £ 500 , 000 donation emerged as the Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mundell , prepared to host an event for the Mackintosh Campus Project at Dover House in London . Mr Mundell said : \" It is a real pleasure to host tonight ' s fundraising event for the Mackintosh Campus , and to support the rebuilding of an iconic British institution which has produced so many leading architects , designers and artists . \" Professor Tom Inns , director of GSA , added : \" It is an important opportunity for us to share our ambitious plans for the campus redevelopment , including bringing together all pathways of the School of Fine Art for the first time in many years in a refurbished Stow Building , and to give an update on the restoration of the Mackintosh Building . \" After the Mackintosh building blaze , an investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded it was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam . The report said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector .", "summ": "a charity has donated # 500,000 to help glasgow school of art ( gsa ) expand its garnethill

Our thoughts and prayers , and that of the whole Nigerian nation , are with you today . ' ' The girls were abducted on the night of April 14 - 15 , 2014 , in the town of Chibok , in northeastern Nigeria , about a two - hour drive from the border with Cameroon . The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants , who are opposed to Western education , particularly for girls . But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics . The militants stormed the school , arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards . Then they forced the girls from their dormitories , loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest . Most have never been seen since , except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi - circle , clad in Islamic dress . They were between 16 and 18 years old . Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all . About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted . Those who did not , it is feared , may have been raped , brutalized , enslaved and forced to convert to Islam . Their parents were stricken with grief . The world was appalled .

Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists , teachers , healthcare workers and retailers . The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology . Surveys suggest that while 99 % of people have heard of autism , only 16 % really understand what it means . In the UK , more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place , such as a restaurant . In order to address this , the UK ' s National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition . The film takes viewers on a journey with a young , autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre . They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around . Mark Lever , chief executive of the National Autistic Society , says he hopes the film will \" help the public understand a little more about autism \" . The film , along with Samsung Gear headsets , was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism . The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube . Alzheimer ' s Research UK also released a VR film this summer , intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia . A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition . Virtual meatballs Virtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something .

In April , furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen . Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space . The app was available through Steam , using the HTC Vive . Gamers are , said Ikea ' s Ingrid Franov , \" not a typical Ikea customer \" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction . \" In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six

In 1987 a coup by indigenous Fijians overthrew the elected , Indian - dominated coalition . This triggered a series of adverse events , including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy . A further coup in 2000 , led by businessman George Speight , saw the country ' s first ethnic Indian prime minister , his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks . These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji ' s international reputation . Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted , with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it . The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji ' s fourth coup in 20 years . In September 2009 , Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy . It was only the second full suspension in the organisation ' s history . In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014 , prompting Fiji ' s powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties . Following the elections the Commonwealth re - instated Fiji as a member . Fiji ' s population , which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu , is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo - Fijians , the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India . The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid - 2000s , by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo - Fijians to flee . Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority . Mixing between the two groups is minimal , and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society . There are also very small non - Indo - Fijian , non - Fijian minority communities , such as Chinese and Rotumans . Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange , its economy is diverse . Gold , silver and limestone are mined , and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing . Nonetheless , Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits , making it one of the world ' s largest per capita recipients of aid .", "summ": "the pacific nation of fiji is the world\\ 's second - largest commonwealth nation .", "model_name": "BERTS2S", "cut": "test", "error_type": ["extrinsic-NP"], "annotated_span": ["pacific nation", "world\\'s second-largest"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [5], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [9], "NP": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]}, {"V": [26], "NP": [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]}, {"V": [28], "NP": [33]}, {"V": [32], "NP": [30, 33]}, {"V": [36], "NP": [35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]}, {"V": [43], "NP": [40, 41, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]}, {"V": [54], "NP": [52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58]}, {"V": [66], "NP": [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 67, 68, 69, 70]}, {"V": [72], "NP": [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]}, {"V": [88], "NP": [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91, 92]}, {"V": [96], "NP": [94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114]}, {"V": [121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135], "NP": [116, 117, 118, 119, 120]}, {"V": [129], "NP": [130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135]}, {"V": [138], "NP": [139]}, {"V": [140], "NP": [137, 138, 139, 141, 142, 143]}, {"V": [144], "NP": [137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160]}, {"V": [168], "NP": [162, 163, 164, 166, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]}, {"V": [181], "NP": [180, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192]}, {"V": [198, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220], "NP": [194, 195, 196, 197, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204]}, {"V": [200], "NP": [196, 197, 201, 202, 203, 204]}, {"V": [206], "NP": [207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]}, {"V": [217], "NP": [207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 218, 219, 220]}, {"V": [222], "NP": [223, 224]}, {"V": [227], "NP": [222, 223, 224, 225, 226]}, {"V": [229], "NP": [222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 230, 231, 232, 233]}, {"V": [241, 242], "NP": [235, 236, 237, 238, 240, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253]}, {"V": [256], "NP": [235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272]}, {"V": [270], "NP": [268, 269, 271, 272]}, {"V": [277], "NP": [274, 275, 276, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302]}, {"V": [295], "NP": [283, 284, 285, 286, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302]}, {"V": [302], "NP": [296, 297, 298, 299, 300]}, {"V": [307], "NP": [304, 305, 306, 309, 310, 311]}, {"V": [313], "NP": [314, 315, 316, 317]}, {"V": [318], "NP": [313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 319]}, {"V": [324, 325], "NP": [322, 323, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331]}, {"V": [334], "NP": [335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354]}, {"V": [361, 362], "NP": [357, 358, 359, 360, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]}, {"V": [356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 376], "NP": [374, 375, 377]}, {"V": [385], "NP": [379, 380, 381, 382, 383]}, {"V": [389], "NP": [390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397]}, {"V": [404, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425], "NP": [399, 401, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410]}, {"V": [412], "NP": [413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425]}]}

Metropolitan Police officers flew out last month to work with Thai police , who are holding two Burmese suspects . The UK detectives will now compile a report and \" update the families of Hannah and David , \" a spokesman said . \" Detectives from the UK who are currently in Thailand reviewing the investigation into the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller have completed their work , as far as possible , \" the Met Police said in a statement . \" They will now be returning to the UK to compile their report and to update the families of Hannah and David on their findings . \" The police team wish to thank the Thai authorities for facilitating the visit . \" Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun , both migrant workers from Myanmar , also known as Burma , are alleged to have confessed to the killings . Thai police have denied subsequent reports that the pair , both aged 21 , have since withdrawn their confessions . The two suspects are charged with conspiracy to murder , conspiracy to rape and robbery , and could face the death penalty if found guilty . However , the UK Foreign Office last month summoned the Thai charge d ' affaires to express concerns about the police investigation . The concerns are understood to have been around the verification of DNA samples of the suspects and allegations of their mistreatment . The UK police visit came after Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan - ocha met Mr Cameron at a summit in Italy and agreed that a delegation of British officers could travel to Thailand .

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls . The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live . The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers . They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education , employment or training by the age of 18 . Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better - off counterparts . And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending . This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account , the researchers said . They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime . The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence , with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts . Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime , the authors said . This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy , substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account . The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime , by the University of Edinburgh ' s School of Law , has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal . The study has tracked 4 , 300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles . It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council , the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government . Report author Prof Lesley McAra said : \" Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence . Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty . \" As a result , contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish . \" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime . A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network ( AQMeN ) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh ' s Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to

Britain is currently the world ' s third largest importer of wood . Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation . Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow . But Confor , which promotes the forestry industry , warns that at least 16 , 000 hectares - or 40 , 000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re - planted to meet needs . Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies . As an industry , it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450 m a year to the Welsh economy . But there is a conflict with environmental policy . Successive ministers have wanted more native , broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife . However , some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents . The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental , the economic and the social in how forestry is developed . It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland . It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \" sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape , provide real social and community benefits , support thriving woodland - based industries and contribute to a better quality environment \" . Martin Bishop , of Confor , which represents 200 businesses in Wales , believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \" sexier \" than commercial forestry . He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas . Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20 , 000 hectares a year to meet long - term targets set by ministers . \" There ' s a huge market for our timber . Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill , \" he added .", "summ": "the welsh government is being urged to take action to protect wales

As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood , the pictures also provide a thought - provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades . The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city ' s streets . The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence , George and Gertie Rollo , who came from Waterloo Park . The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants . The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle , Alderman and Mrs Howard . As well as showing children at play , another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work . A nervous looking young maid for a well - to - do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900 . The exhibition has been put together by Kay Jones , Curator of Urban Community History at the Museum of Liverpool . Ms Jones painstakingly trawled through hundreds of images from the National Museums Liverpool ' s collections before deciding on the final 25 for the exhibition . She said : \" This has been a fascinating exhibition to work on . \" Looking through hundreds of different postcards , photographs and glass plate negatives in our collections ; it was hard to decide on the final 25 images . \" I chose the ones that really stood out and told the experience of childhood . \" People love seeing old photographs and most people can relate to the same experiences of playing out in the street if they ' re from Liverpool or anywhere else . \" But , at the same time , the pictures also remind us of how things have changed . \" I didn ' t want it to be just happy memories , I also wanted to remember the children who had to work throughout their childhood . \" I wanted it to be the good and bad experiences of childhood . \" Growing Up in the City is at the

Mr Swinney said 4 . 2 % of that reduction would come between now and 2019 - 20 . He said : \" The chancellor ( George Osborne ) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020 , and more than £ 1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade . \" We have demonstrated that the UK government didn ' t have to take this approach . Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor . \" Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor ' s decision . We face tough choices in the coming days . \" Against this backdrop , the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on . \" Mr Swinney said schools , hospitals and the police service in Scotland would \" not be sacrificed to the chancellor ' s austerity obsession \" . He added : \" In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland . More police , lower crime , better schools , tuition - free university education and a health budget that is at a record level . \" These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government . \" Responding to Mr Swinney comments , a spokesman for the UK government ' s Scotland Office said : \" The Scottish government will have £ 390 m more spending available to it next year , which rises to £ 750 m if you include its own underspend . \" The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £ 30bn . \" One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government . \" The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland , rather than grievance . \" Labour ' s public services spokeswoman Jackie", "summ": "scotland\\ 's finance secretary john swinney has accused the scottish government

Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool ' s Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level .

What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea - bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus - centric defence . Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium , leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter - attacking brilliance - which Bonucci ' s 50 - yard , defence - splitting pass and Giaccherini ' s cool finish provided .

The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40 % of the national vote .

Southampton ' s Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break . Belgium were very disappointing , with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal . Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool ' s Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level . Before the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality , and even coach Antonio Conte said : \" It isn ' t a good time for our football . \" The soon - to - be - Chelsea boss added : \" It ' s important the squad has a good spirit . I work a lot at this . \" On the evidence of this game , that is not the only thing he has worked at .

Both sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden , who drew 1 - 1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday . With 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage , Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their likeliest challengers . Italy have won this competition once , in 1968 , and finished runners - up twice - most recently in 2012 , when they were demolished 4 - 0 by Spain in the final . While the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying , winning seven of their 10 matches , they compare unfavourably with the side of four years ago , lacking the calm , creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli . What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea - bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus - centric defence . Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium , leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter - attacking brilliance - which Bonucci ' s 50 - yard , defence - splitting pass and Giaccherini ' s cool finish provided .

Whether you are being rejected by a lover , an employer or a barman who serves a newly arrived regular customer before you , it ’ s galling . And in every case there ’ s nothing we can do about it . Nothing that doesn ’ t carry a long prison sentence , anyway . It would take someone exceptionally optimistic and uncynical to propose an alternative thesis , and Jia Jiang is both of those . Born into a family of teachers , Jia Jiang was so determined to become an entrepreneur that , as a child in China , he dug a hole in the garden , intending to reach America by the shortest route . He eventually made the journey by conventional means , and found a good life there . Wife , children , several degrees , job in middle management . But he wasn ’ t happy . He wanted to take risks , start his own company . It doesn ' t matter where it comes from - no one likes being rejected and in each and every case there ’ s nothing we can do about it ( picture posed by model ) . The problem was he inevitably encountered rejection , mainly from potential backers for his project ( another iPhone app no one could possibly need or want ) . And each time , rejection felt like the end of the world . A successful entrepreneur needed to be more robust than this . So , having possibly read one self - help book too many , Jia Jiang decided to embark on his own rejection - proofing quest . Instead of avoiding rejection , he would spend 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected , film them and put them up on his blog . All of which seemed to me , at first glance , rather artificial . There have been any number of ‘ quest ’ books , in which humorous writers have gone round Ireland with a fridge , for example , less for the sake of doing it than to write a book about it . But Jia Jiang isn ’ t a humorous writer . He may adopt a light - hearted tone , but his quest was deadly serious . On day one , he went up to a security guard and asked if he could borrow $ 100 . The security guard said no , and Jia almost broke into a run to get away . Watching the video later , he said he looked like the man in Munch ’ s The Scream . On day two , he went into a burger joint and , noticing a sign on the soft drinks", "summ": "Jia Jiang spent 100 days deliberately seeking out situations in which he was likely to be rejected .

Seven - year - old Charlotte Briggs was told she can not attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window . . Her mother Lynne , 49 , who has two other children , claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job . Unhappy : Charlotte Briggs , seven , was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away , so her mother Lynne , pictured together , must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back . Decision : The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary , which is around two miles away . Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield , where Charlotte is a student , was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior , so only put one school on Charlotte ' s admission form . The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon , 55 , - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor . But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying . Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed , so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her . Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away . She said : ' I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment , we live about as close to the school as possible . . Rejected : Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School ( above ) in Sheffield , even though she can see it from her bedroom window . ' Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors . ' The council uses an \" as the crow flies \" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window , all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses .

And Martinez claimed referee Michael Oliver should have risen above the appeals from the Swansea faithful and used ' common sense ' to rule in favour of Everton . Seamus Coleman falls over under the challenge from Marvin Emnes and handles the ball Coleman appears to apologise to the visiting fans at the full - time whistle , but his manager says he was fouled Martinez said on BT Sport 1 : ' My thoughts are that straight away there is contact . Seamus tells me straight away there is contact and he gets unbalanced . ' Sometimes you need to apply a little bit of common sense . ' Clearly there ' s contact . I ' ve seen it many times given as a free - kick . ' The whole action for me is too soft . I don ' t think that there ' s enough threat or a goalscoring threat to give a penalty . ' He ' s trying to protect the ball and gets unbalanced and from that point he expects the free - kick to be given . The Everton players protest but Michael Oliver deemed Coleman ' s handball deliberate , and gave a penalty Jonjo Shelvey made no mistake from the spot as the former Liverpool midfielder equalised for Swansea ' It ' s one of those actions where you expect the referee to be a little bit more above the occasion . ' You felt the crowd were asking for two or three decisions and it was building up to a decision and unfortunately we were on the receiving end . ' Martinez labelled the result ' a real disappointment ' , after Aaron Lennon ' s first - half strike had looked set to give the visitors all three points . Jonjo Shelvey tucked away the penalty equaliser in the 69th minute . Martinez added : ' The only criticism is we had a period of 10 , 15 , 20 minutes where we were too comfortable in the second half and didn ' t find that final shot or try to score the second goal , but apart from that I do feel the draw doesn ' t reflect what happened .

Pollsters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government . A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented , while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately . Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1 , 000 adults between 19 and 25 March . Click here to see the full results . Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals , which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits . Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6 . 8 Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7 . 2 Increase minimum wage to £ 7 . 2 The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions , which scored 7 . 3 out of 10 on the scale . Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits , with a score of 7 . Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum . When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10 , where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly , each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores . Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7 . 3 out of 10 , a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits ( 7 . 1 ) , full control of income tax ( 6 . 8 ) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs ( 6 . Interestingly , analysis shows that , for each of these issues , support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted ' Yes ' in last year ' s referendum . Read Mark ' s analysis of the poll . The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6 . Still popular , but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6 . 5 , was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy .

He understood the horror of it instantly . He let his head rest on the grass and closed his eyes as if he was trying to wish it all away , as if he was trying to blot out the din and the agony and the wild celebrations of the Arsenal fans . His face was scrunched against the grass , distorted in a mask of despair . Reading , still struggling to avoid relegation to League One , had performed heroically to push Arsenal into extra - time in this FA Cup semi - final and Federici had pulled off a series of stunning saves to keep the sides level at 1 - 1 but the Australian goalkeeper guessed there would be no way back now . There had been less than a minute to go before the extra - time interval when Alexis Sanchez had cut in from the left and fired in a stinging shot straight at Federici . He knelt to gather it but somehow it squirmed through his legs and trickled over the line as he scrambled in vain to retrieve it . It was football at its most cruel . In years to come , it will be the enduring image of this game . Alexis Sanchez ' s low shot squirmed agonisingly through the legs of Reading goalkeeper Adam Federici in extra time . It was a routine shot from Sanchez but the Reading stopper failed to collect it properly in his grasp - an embarrassing gaffe . The ball rolled through his legs and slowly towards the goal line in the 106th minute of the game . Federici tries desperately to stop the ball going over the line after it rolled through his legs and out of his grasp . Reading had fought valiantly but were unable to score another equaliser to take the tie to penalties . Federici lies slumped on the ground as the impact of his error hits him in the FA Cup semi - final against Arsenal . The Reading goalkeeper , who had been magnificent until then , left the field in tears as manager Steve Clarke tries to console him .

And Greece ' s resorts are teeming : Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year , up from 21 million ; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels , Frankfurt and Washington ( home of the IMF ) .

But why aren ' t the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already - announced , painful VAT increases and pension cuts , and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies , controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition ? Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â ‚ ¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and ( well maybe ) the IMF , in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country . Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year . Presumably the explanation is that Greece ' s near - death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA ( \" there is no alternative \" ) . What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular , in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal ( tax and spending ) austerity . Worse , his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too : the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend . Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment , but if retailers and wholesalers can ' t get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad , Christmas will be cancelled ( 70 % of shops ' orders are placed in September and October , bankers tell me ) .

Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable . But in a landmark ruling , appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ' extravagant or unconscionable ' . Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision , accusing the judges – who are thought to earn more than £ 200 , 000 a year – of being ' out of touch ' . Mr Beavis , from Chelmsford , Essex , had gone to court to fight what he called the ' bullying and threatening ' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces . The 48 - year - old , who runs a fish and chip shop , got the £ 85 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford . The car park , run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd , allowed two hours of free parking , but Mr Beavis stayed for three . He claimed the £ 85 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who ' extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up ' . But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not ' excessively high ' . Mr Beavis said he was ' absolutely furious ' and planned to appeal . Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit - hungry firms ' falling over themselves ' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose . Ian Taylor , of the Alliance of British Drivers , said : ' I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think £ 85 isn ' t extravagant . ' An £ 85 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer – it ' s probably less than many charge for an hour . But for the average hard - pressed motorist trying to make ends meet , it ' s a very heavy and unfair burden . ' Professor Stephen Glaister , director of the RAC Foundation , said the ruling would hand parking firms a ' blank cheque ' to milk drivers", "summ": "barry beavis , 48 , from chelmsford , essex , was

Blended into the background , these models are difficult to tell apart from their surroundings . Camouflaged in body paint , women pose for the camera against a backdrop of overgrown woodland . A series of pictures by German artist Jörg Düsterwald show body - painted models camouflaged in woodland In many of the pictures , the intricate detailing of the paint on the naked bodies means it is virtually impossible to determine where the person is . The jaw - dropping artwork is the brainchild of Jörg Düsterwald , a 49 - year - old artist and bodypainter from Hameln , Germany . Jörg has been actively producing body art projects for the last 20 years and uses his body - painting skills in a range of creative projects including advertising , corporate events , and TV marketing campaigns . His work has featured in several art magazines and in 2008 he was awarded the German brush - painting champion at a national competition . The artist places the model next to a tree half - painted and then adds the details to make her blend into the environment Some of the models are so well camouflaged that it is impossible to work out where they are The artist is a well - renowned body painter who has used his skills in TV adverts The photoshoots , which take several hours to complete are heavily planned before the artist arrives at the location with the model . The pre - painted model is then placed against an item like a tree or a mossy log and then Jörg adds details that will help to camouflage her using his portable paint kit .

The white - cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south - east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps . The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area . Scroll down for video The white - cheeked macaque , from Tibet , China , has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys , it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face . Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet . Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis , but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom . An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species . He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners , or even as a way of cooling the body down . The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest ' How Did We Get Here ? ' video series for the University of New South Wales , Australia . Gorillas have small penises and small testicles , while chimps have medium - sized penises and large testicles . By comparison , human males have the longest penis and medium - sized testicles . ' Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs , especially the testicles , are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially , ' explained Professor Curnoe . ' Why the difference ? Well for the testicles it ' s pretty straight forward . ' It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps , and their sperm , have when they mate with females . ' But he said there wasn ' t a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes .

Pollsters Ipsos Mori asked voters to give a score out of 10 to a range of policies which could be implemented by the next UK government . A ranking of one meant it should not be implemented , while 10 meant it should be implemented immediately . Ipsos Mori surveyed more than 1 , 000 adults between 19 and 25 March . Click here to see the full results . Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals , which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits . Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6 . 8 Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7 . 2 Increase minimum wage to £ 7 . 2 The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions , which scored 7 . 3 out of 10 on the scale . Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits , with a score of 7 . Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum . When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10 , where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly , each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores . Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7 . 3 out of 10 , a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits ( 7 . 1 ) , full control of income tax ( 6 . 8 ) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs ( 6 . Interestingly , analysis shows that , for each of these issues , support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted ' Yes ' in last year ' s referendum . Read Mark ' s analysis of the poll . The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6 . Still popular , but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6 . 5 , was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "37838086", "doc": "After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result , Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered . Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third . Extend , yes , but for just one more year . Superficially , it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge . Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to ? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote ? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind : how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two ? The third , it appears , was the clincher . When Mr Carney took office in 2013 , the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later ( a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation , Pascal Lamy , as something akin to \" taking an egg out of omelette \" ) , was a remote one . But that all changed on 23 June . Beyond trying to stabilise the economy , it also created a personal issue for the Governor . If he left in 2018 as originally agreed , it would be right in the middle of Britain ' s exit negotiations . Should he , therefore , extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve ? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets . And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed , telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \" wanted to serve \" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years .

It is only six months since Steven Gerrard ' s slip helped the Blues clinch a famous win on Merseyside that derailed Liverpool ' s title bid . Back then , at the end of April , the title was in the Reds ' grasp . This weekend , I think we will see again how far away they are from mounting another title challenge . They are miles away from the level required for that , and will have to improve and work hard just to get in the top four . If they manage it , then securing back - to - back seasons in the Champions League should be seen as success for Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . But not all their fans see it that way . I had some unhappy Reds supporters calling me up on 606 on BBC Radio 5 live last weekend to give their manager stick . Part of Liverpool ' s problem is that they overachieved massively last season , which has raised expectations unrealistically . That is not Rodgers ' fault . Where he can be questioned is in the transfer market , especially up front . Between them Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge scored 52 of Liverpool ' s 101 Premier League goals last season . With Suarez sold and Sturridge playing only three out of 10 league games so far this season because of injury , Rodgers has lost a lot of goals from his line - up . But he has had money to spend and I do not think he has bought the right strikers to fit his system . Looking at Rodgers ' options up front for Saturday , Mario Balotelli , Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are his three available front men , and the bottom line is that they are not good enough . It is not just that they do not look like scoring . There is a big difference in their work - rate compared to what Suarez and Sturridge gave the team . That means Liverpool are not starting games with the same intensity they did last season , or pressing teams high up the pitch to force them into mistakes . Doing that in 2013 - 14 Liverpool scored 59 first - half goals , 13 more than any other team , and scored in the first half of 34 out of 38 league matches - again the most in the top flight .",

Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite , who took 3 - 48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes . After losing Adam Lyth early , Yorkshire were well - placed on 75 - 2 , but fast bowler Meaker ( 3 - 61 ) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow ( 13 ) , who lobbed tamely to mid - wicket , Ballance ( 32 ) and Jack Leaning . Bresnan and Waite ( 38 ) did their best to repair the damage , but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long - off with seven balls remaining . Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London : \" Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires , everybody ' s pulling together . \" Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent , that partnership blew the game wide open . \" The position we got ourselves to , I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270 . \" But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs . \" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees : \" We are all gutted . We have played some great white - ball cricket this season , but when it has mattered we haven ' t been good enough . \" The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target . We needed someone in the top five to make a contribution and we would have reached the target comfortably . \"", "summ": "yorkshire reached the one - day cup quarter - finals with a run - chase

They found evidence of common UK accent changes , such as the use of \" f \" for \" th \" in words like think , and a dropped letter ' l ' , as in people to peopo . Overall though , the researchers said the Scots accent remained distinctive . The three - year Sounds of the City study , was led by Professor Jane Stuart - Smith , director of the university ' s laboratory of phonetics . \" We were quite surprised by what we found , \" she said . \" The assumption is that traditional dialects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether , but what we have learned , particularly with the Glasgow accent , is that Scots accents are actually flourishing . \" Interestingly , what is not happening in Scotland is the dilution of accents to a more homogenised anglicised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England , and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive . \" As part of its study , the Glasgow team built up a digitised body of recorded speech sounds . The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes . One set are common accent changes , which have spread right across the UK , such as the \" f \" and \" l \" examples . The team said this change was being spread partly by dialect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London . The project also uncovered a second set of finer changes local to Scotland . These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat , goat and coat , or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin , top and cat . The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time , or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo - English accents . Their evidence suggested , however , that these features and others were all changing , the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo - English changes , and that they had been happening for 100 years or more . The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War . The study focused on six audio recordings , made in 1916 and held by the British Library , of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps . From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago , and perhaps even earlier , Scottish accents were already changing .

Ian Bell and Joe Root both scored 60 and Ben Stokes 42 as England surged further ahead in the afternoon session to the delight of a buoyant Cardiff crowd . And although wickets fell regularly in a frenetic finale , Mark Wood ' s unbeaten 32 helped England reach 289 all out to set Australia an improbable 412 to win . Only two teams in Test history have successfully chased that many runs , with Australia ' s best effort the 404 - 3 by Don Bradman ' s ' Invincibles ' at Headingley in 1948 . England set the tone for a near - perfect day with an electric performance on the third morning , executing their plans to perfection to finish off the Australia innings . Shane Watson ' s vulnerability to lbws was brilliantly exploited as Stuart Broad dismissed him for 30 in the second over of the day before Wood pinned Nathan Lyon in front of his stumps . James Anderson found swing with the new ball to induce edges from Brad Haddin and Mitchell Starc , with Broad removing Mitchell Johnson in between . In little more than an hour , England had advanced from a position of relative strength to one of total control . After a nervy start with the bat - failures for Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance left England teetering on 22 - 2 - their second innings found momentum . Adam Lyth showed his mettle with a fluent 37 , but the main catalyst was Bell , who put a dreadful sequence of 56 runs in nine innings behind him with a fine half - century . The Warwickshire batsman went on the front foot from the off , lashing two cover drives in one Mitchell Starc over and peppering the third - man boundary with his trademark late cut . He reached fifty off 75 balls , and underlined his new - found confidence by crashing Johnson over cover for his 11th four . The next ball brought Bell ' s undoing however , as , clearly expecting the short ball , he backed away slightly and was clean bowled to give Johnson his first wicket of the match . By the time of Bell ' s dismissal , England were flying and the in - form duo of Root and Stokes kept them airborne , with both finding the boundary nine times . A mini - collapse from 207 - 4 to 245 - 8 in the last session gave Australia a glimmer of hope , only for England to find inspiration from an unlikely source .", "summ": "england\\ 's joe root and joe root both scored centuries as australia took control on the second day of the second test at edgbaston .", "model_name": "TranS2S", "cut": "test", "error_type": ["extrinsic-NP", "extrinsic-predicate"], "annotated_span": ["both scored centuries", "edgbaston", "second day", "centuries", "joe root"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [8], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]}, {"V": [12], "NP": [11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [2], "NP": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]}, {"V": [16], "NP": [0, 1, 17, 19, 20]}, {"V": [22], "NP": [0, 1, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]}, {"V": [37], "NP": [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59]}, {"V": [45, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59], "NP": [44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]}, {"V": [64], "NP": [63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]}, {"V": [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 77], "NP": [61, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]}, {"V": [79], "NP": [78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]}, {"V": [84], "NP": [78, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]}, {"V": [90], "NP": [86, 87, 88]}, {"V": [99, 100, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126], "NP": [92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 101, 102, 103]}, {"V": [129, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157], "NP": [128, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137]}, {"V": [147, 150, 151], "NP": [128, 148, 149, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]}, {"V": [153], "NP": [128, 155, 156, 157]}, {"V": [167, 168], "NP": [159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192]}, {"V": [172], "NP": [170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192]}, {"V": [185], "NP": [184, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192]}, {"V": [196], "NP": [194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218]}, {"V": [203], "NP": [194, 195, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210]}, {"V": [214], "NP": [213, 215, 216, 217]}, {"V": [229], "NP": [220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 227, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240]}, {"V": [257], "NP": [242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266]}, {"V": [259], "NP": [258, 260, 261, 262, 263]}, {"V": [268], "NP": [265, 266, 267, 269]}, {"V": [273, 276, 277, 278, 279], "NP": [271, 272, 274, 275]}, {"V": [285], "NP": [282, 283, 284, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]}, {"V": [289, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306], "NP": [286, 288, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300]}, {"V": [311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340], "NP": [308, 309, 310, 316, 317, 318]}, {"V": [320], "NP": [308, 309, 310, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328]}, {"V": [330], "NP": [308, 309, 310, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340]}, {"V": [343], "NP": [342, 344, 345, 346, 347]}, {"V": [350, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364], "NP": [342, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355]}, {"V": [354], "NP": [352, 355]}, {"V": [357, 361, 362, 363, 364], "NP": [342, 358, 359, 360]}, {"V": [369], "NP": [366, 367, 368, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400]}, {"V": [373], "NP": [370, 371, 372]}, {"V": [378, 379], "NP": [380, 381, 382, 384]}, {"V": [378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 385, 387], "NP": [384, 386]}, {"V": [389], "NP": [378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 384, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400]}, {"V": [378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 390, 391], "NP": [384, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400]}, {"V": [393], "NP": [384, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400]}, {"V": [413], "NP": [402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411]}, {"V": [424, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434], "NP": [415, 416, 417, 418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423, 425, 426]}, {"V": [430], "NP": [429, 431, 432, 433, 434]}, {"V": [452, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468], "NP": [436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457]}, {"V": [459, 463], "NP": [461, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468]}]}

It will now examine the data collected by the British Geological Survey ( BGS ) before deciding whether to resume . A tremor centred on Poulton - le - Fylde on 1 April shared a \" similar location and mechanism \" , the BSG said . Shale gas drilling , known as \" fracking \" , involves shattering hard shale rocks underground to release gas using either hydraulic pressure or tiny explosions . Mark Miller , chief executive of Cuadrilla Resources , said : \" We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have stopped fracking operations to share information and consult with the relevant authorities and other experts . \" We expect that this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions after that . \" The process has proved controversial in the US with environmentalists alleging that shale gas leaking into their drinking supply could cause tap water to ignite . But earlier this month the Commons energy select committee called on ministers to support the process in the UK arguing that environmental problems associated with it in the US could be overcome by tight regulation and good industry practice . The BGS said it was also monitoring fracking as a precaution . There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March , including the latest on Friday . In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said : \" Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes . \" It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering , such as Shale gas , processes can result in earthquake activity . \" The BGS said the April tremor took place 1 . 2 miles ( 2 km ) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles ( 80 km ) away . Speaking about the latest quake , Dr Brian Baptie , head of seismology at the BGS , said : \" The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton - Le - Fylde . \" Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2 km of the Preese Hall site . \" Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site , installed after the magnitude 2 . 3 earthquake on 1", "summ": "fracking

But he now faces at least a year at a militant rehabilitation centre in Kuwait , according to the terms of the release . The Kuwaiti government had pushed hard for the release of all Kuwaiti detainees at Guantanamo . Mr Odah had argued that he travelled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to teach the Koran and provide humanitarian aid .

But transition spokesman Jason Miller ' s insistence that the Trumps were \" energised and excited about their new role serving the country \" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media . \" First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world , \" wrote one Twitter user , Pamela Benbow . \" Melania Trump ' s decision is appalling . \" Others joked it was Mrs Trump ' s taste in interiors which had prompted the decision , while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps ' marriage . However , the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising . There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands ' years as commander - in - chief : Martha Washington , because it had yet to be built , and Anna Harrison , because her husband died before she could take up residence . But Mrs Trump ' s decision has its supporters . \" Good , this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron ' s age , \" one Twitter user noted . However , it is not out of character for Mrs Trump , who has repeatedly stressed that Barron , 10 , is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers . But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House . So how have families coped before ? William Seale , a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President ' s House , said President Grover Cleveland ' s wife , Frances Folsom Cleveland , only lived in the White House during social season . The president bought a house during his first term , where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time . The first lady referred to the first home as \" Oak View \" but it was more commonly known as \" Red Top \" because of its red roof . But the young bride , who was age 21 when she married the 49 - year - old president , was the only first lady to be married in the White House . \" The concern of children staying back to finish

Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits , such as lower levels of body fat , reduced heart disease risk factors , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes . But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain . They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins , who were all men aged 32 to 36 years . Focusing on twins , who have the same DNA , would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies . In each pair of twins , one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other , though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives . Dr Kujala said : ' On average , the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co - twins . ' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains , and specific regions . Exercise didn ' t seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole , Dr Kujala said . But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement , he added . Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar , which reduces the risk of diabetes , a finding which is already well - known .

The school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault - - even when the student admitted to it . The Virginia attorney general asked the law firm of O ' Melveny & Myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . That includes how UVA officials handled the allegations in the discredited Rolling Stone article by a student the magazine called ` ` Jackie , ' ' especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . The alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and Jackie told the university about it the next spring . She started telling her story very publicly , including at a ` ` take back the night ' ' rally . But Charlottesville police did n ' t hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which Jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . When a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . In both cases , police said Jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . But more women came forward to talk about their experiences - - women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as Jackie ' s . Rolling Stone ' s story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . Many women told CNN about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . They ' d call it a ` ` bad experience . ' ' Others told CNN that there were fraternities with reputations for being ` ` rapey ' ' and for using date - rape drugs . That some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman ' s outfit . And if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n ' t seem worth it if their abuser would n ' t be kicked out of school . Rolling Stone had a line in its original story : ` ` UVA ' s emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor - code violations such as cheating on exams",

The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field . And it could also explain why certain rare - earth elements in Earth ’ s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet ’ s other building blocks - meteorites . Oxford scientists say a Mercury - like body struck the young Earth ( artist ' s illustration shown ) . The object would have been the heat source for our planet ' s core . The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon . It also explains where some rare - Earth elements came from The study , by two scientists from the University of Oxford , was published in the journal Nature . Our current theory of Earth ’ s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body . However , this model can not explain where the heat source for Earth ’ s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from . In addition , Earth ’ s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare - earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth ’ s formation than first thought . To address this discrepancy , scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life . This likely would have happened about 4 . 5 billion years ago . The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury . Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago . This is called the giant impact hypothesis . The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4 . 5 billion years ago . The colliding body is sometimes called Theia , after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene , the goddess of the Moon . But one mystery has persisted , revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition ? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon . Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon . Or Theia could have , coincidentally , been isotopically similar to young Earth . A third possibility is that the", "summ": "dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field . the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's

Its chief executive David Babington said it will help prepare pupils for the stresses of the transfer test and big changes in their educational life . Five schools took part in a pilot . The charity is now hoping the programme will be rolled out in schools across Northern Ireland .

The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "38285834", "doc": "The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty , a US - based environmental lobby group . Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder , Singapore state - owned investment company Temasek , of turning a blind eye to these practices . Both companies reject the allegations . Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash - and - burn practices by small - scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia . Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil , pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra , South Sumatra , and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo . Singapore - based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99 % of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry , it says it accounts for less than 1 % of the global market . Mighty ' s report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires . It also says Olam created a \" secretive market for rogue palm oil companies \" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources . But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \" very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning , so it ' s a ' no burn - no peat - no deforestation ' compliance policy \" . The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday , having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so . Mr Verghese said he believed the firm ' s current suppliers all met Olam ' s strict requirements , but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete . He added that producers who do not comply with the company ' s sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain . Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam , Mighty ' s allegations could link Singapore ' s state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore , Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven . Temasek ' s investment in Olam means that \" the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world ' s black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze , \" the report says .

In the 1990s , he was a star player at the University of Nebraska , making him a sought - after rookie in the NFL . Phillips played for the St Louis Rams , Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999 , but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field . After his NFL career , Phillips continued to have problems with the law . Eventually , he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers . In another case , he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend . Phillips , who was serving a term of more than 30 years , had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate .

The Russian state \" is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot \" and had \" reasons aplenty \" for wishing him \" not only harm , but death \" , he said . UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko , 43 , in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing . Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium - 210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi . He died in hospital nearly three weeks later . The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation , Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks . He said : \" The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko ' s murder . \" However , he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder . Defecting to the UK in 2000 , after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption , could have been seen as \" akin to treachery \" , he said . He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko ' s \" many personal attacks on Putin \" . Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known , and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run - up to his death . He said : \" The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage . They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise . \" We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long - term effects will be visited upon Londoners . \" Mr Horwell said the suspects left a \" trail of polonium \" behind and they had \" no credible answer \" to the scientific evidence against them .

But transition spokesman Jason Miller ' s insistence that the Trumps were \" energised and excited about their new role serving the country \" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media . \" First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world , \" wrote one Twitter user , Pamela Benbow . \" Melania Trump ' s decision is appalling . \" Others joked it was Mrs Trump ' s taste in interiors which had prompted the decision , while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps ' marriage . However , the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising . There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands ' years as commander - in - chief : Martha Washington , because it had yet to be built , and Anna Harrison , because her husband died before she could take up residence . But Mrs Trump ' s decision has its supporters . \" Good , this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron ' s age , \" one Twitter user noted . However , it is not out of character for Mrs Trump , who has repeatedly stressed that Barron , 10 , is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers . But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House . So how have families coped before ? William Seale , a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President ' s House , said President Grover Cleveland ' s wife , Frances Folsom Cleveland , only lived in the White House during social season . The president bought a house during his first term , where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time . The first lady referred to the first home as \" Oak View \" but it was more commonly known as \" Red Top \" because of its red roof . But the young bride , who was age 21 when she married the 49 - year - old president , was the only first lady to be married in the White House . \" The concern of children staying back to finish school - that ' s more typical than not , \" Mr Seale said . \" It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school .", "summ": "donald trump\\ 's daughter

Smith , now manager of the Endura racing team , trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe .

He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut . \" Didn ' t I see you win the Glasgow - Dunoon race in the ' 80s ? \" Smith , from Paisley and now based in Kent , replied that he had indeed won , aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25 - mile section .

Scroll down for video Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday But the rules do not apply to everyone , it seems . Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off . The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8 , 500 staff , but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work . For the rest of the country , it ' s back to work on Monday . The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel ' entitled ' to the day off , reports Courier Mail . ' Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off , Australians have an entitlement mentality , ' said Mr Dundon , the boss of Direct Health Solutions . ' They ' re missing out and people want their fair share . ' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent - 25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27 . In turn , some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day , they risk losing their job . In Queensland alone , losses to businesses are estimated at more than $ 7 . 5 million if an expected 20 , 000 workers call in sick . The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year , meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation . The reason was to avoid ' costs and disruption for business ' that occurred when every state had different laws .

It aimed to reach that amount to \" bring to justice those responsible for the war and the deaths of our loved ones \" . The campaign was led by Reg Keys and Roger Bacon , who lost sons in Iraq . The funding bid began after the publication last month of the long - awaited report by Sir John Chilcot into the 2003 invasion . Chilcot report : Findings at - a - glance The campaign group initially aimed to reach £ 50 , 000 via crowdfunding , but extended its target after raising that figure in nine hours on the CrowdJustice website . It has now received enough backing to fund the whole campaign . Mr Keys and Mr Bacon said in a statement : \" This is great proof of the underlying support from the British people in our quest for answers and for justice . \" It is startling and humbling at the same time . \" The money raised will allow the group ' s lawyers , McCue and Partners - currently working free of charge - to analyse the 2 . 6 million - word report by Sir John and prepare \" a comprehensive opinion approved by expert senior counsel \" . This would provide guidance on whether legal action against key people involved in the invasion of Iraq would succeed or not . The Chilcot report did not make any findings on whether individuals acted unlawfully . However , it rejected the legal basis for UK military action , and said then - prime minister Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by then - President of Iraq Saddam Hussein and sent ill - prepared troops into battle .

Last week , Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands . China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims . Beijing claims a U - shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory . The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims . Last week , several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig . Reports suggest the stand - off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing , with water cannon fire being exchanged . On Sunday , anti - China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities . It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years . In Monday ' s telephone call , Mr Kerry \" said China ' s introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative \" , US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said . \" He urged both sides to de - escalate tensions , ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea , and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law . \" Separately , in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister , Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an \" aggressive act \" . Mr Wang , meanwhile , urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue , a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said . Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high , after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal . The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims . It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence , in a move seen as linked to Manila ' s deteriorating ties with Beijing . On Tuesday , Chinese state media slammed the Philippines , saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay \" an unaffordable price \" .", "summ": "china has accused the us of a stand -

The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe . In particular , the project wants every school to have a connection . Building so large a constellation requires a step - change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus . It can take Europe ’ s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today ’ s specialist platforms . But for the OneWeb venture , it is all about high volume and low cost . That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes . The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece . The boss of Airbus , Tom Enders , concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy . \" Everything in space as you know traditionally has been ' gold - plated ' ; it had to work perfectly , [ and have ] the most expensive materials , etc . \" Here , we ’ ve had to go other ways , to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb , \" he told BBC News . Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse , France . Two further lines will be set up in a soon - to - open factory complex in Florida . The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot , which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations . But the \" revolution \" here goes far beyond automation ; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan . The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year . Another batch will follow into orbit around November . And then the launch cadence will kick on apace . The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight . More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32 - 36 satellites into a web some 1 , 200 km above the Earth . There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020 , the start of 2021 ; more than 600 about a year or so later ; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade .

People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce . It means an extra £ 2 , 100 a year – £ 17 , 800 rather than £ 15 , 700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact , or who has never married , according to the survey for the Prudential . It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles . The debt of a divorced retiree averages £ 22 , 100 , Prudential ’ s report said , while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers . Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £ 9 , 500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life . By comparison , only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line , yesterday ’ s report said . The impact of divorce on a former spouse ’ s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working . The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up . Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school , worse in their careers after they leave school , to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime , and to suffer worse health . The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult , studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands , wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income , the price of running two homes instead of one , legal costs , and the long - term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches . Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children , a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘ pension - splitting ’ arrangements .

Their promotion capped a remarkable rise from the brink of bankruptcy a decade earlier and almost being relegated out of the Football League altogether in 2003 . Curtis - a former player who was at the club throughout their rise up the divisions - believes the Swans have not been the same since Michael Laudrup left in 2014 . \" I think we have [ lost our way ] . It ' s just the change of management all the time , \" Curtis added . \" The best eras were Roberto Martinez , Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup . But we ' ve probably lost a bit of the ' Swansea Way ' .

Five competitions between them , five golds won . As of Tuesday night , had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table , above Jamaica , Kenya and Brazil . That would be to misunderstand what makes them tick . This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders . You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire . Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games , more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins . Trott has four , more than any other British woman , and from one fewer Olympics . That would be to misjudge their relationship . Cycling superstars on their own , together they can be almost ordinary , almost invisible . After the gold rush , after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on , that may be about to change . \" The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them , \" says Trott ' s father Adrian . \" Until he gets to know you , Jason is a little bit shy . He ' s quiet and understated . Laura is bubbly , chatty , just as you see in her interviews . \" If they were both like Jason , God only knows how they ' d talk about anything . And God forbid having two Lauras in a household ! \" The relationship between the two began in the build - up to London 2012 , with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy ' s muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first . \" I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago , \" says Kenny ' s mother Lorraine . \" I said to my husband , ' Flipping heck , you need to watch this young lady . ' She was in the elimination race , only a tiny thing , and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone .

Bates was charged with second - degree manslaughter Monday . He surrendered Tuesday morning , accompanied by his attorney , Clark Brewster , and immediately posted bail of $ 25 , 000 .

It said the council tax had built - in problems \" from day one \" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers . The commission , set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla , will report back later this year . Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow , was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world . He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \" good tax \" because it was stable , difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets . But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection . Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income . Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax , used by many countries , was generally perceived as fairer . But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated . There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities . He said : \" It is clear there is no magic bullet . \" Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform . \" So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies , change and reform is a major undertaking . \" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn . A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \" as a whole to be unfair \" .

Johnson was a popular pick to win the first major of the year as a result of the fine form he has shown in 2017 . He has won the past three tournaments in which he has competed - February ' s Genesis Open , and both the WGC Mexico Championship and WGC Dell Match Play in March . As well as winning last year ' s US Open by four shots , he finished ninth at the Open Championship and tied fourth at the Masters .

Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn ' t be able to shake off their sulky , angry , teen characters . But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O ' Connell for example , they couldn ' t have been more wrong . Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest - serving members of the cast , appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem . She went on to appear in sci - fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp . Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience . He ' d starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002 . He has since gone on to play Beast in the X - Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals . Dev Patel ' s first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two , took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire . He told Newsbeat , he never would have got that role without Skins . \" My career started off because Danny Boyle ' s daughter was a fan of the show , that is how I got an audition for Slumdog . \" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment , The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie , starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman . Jack O ' Connell , who played Cook in series three and four , was hand - picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken . The 24 - year - old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year ' s Baftas . Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively . It is , of course , not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films . What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel . So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors ?

A team of cancer specialists , GPs , NHS and public health experts from Wales have just returned from a fact - finding visit to Aarhus , Denmark ' s second city . So what was the problem ? Prof Frede Olesen of Aarhus University said the changes followed \" quite alarming \" cancer survival statistics more than 15 years ago showing Denmark was performing poorly compared to other European countries , including the rest of Scandinavia . Part of the problem was that waiting times patients faced before getting diagnosed were too long . It was not so much the most serious cases where patients came to the GP with obvious symptoms . They could be fast - tracked to specialists in hospital . It was the cancer cases where patients either had vague or more difficult to diagnose symptoms - or the small number of cancers found in patients who said they were ill but mostly needed a quick test or scan to rule something serious out . \" We looked at 30 , 000 cancer cases - and more than 25 % of all cancer cases were from this group where we didn ' t think it was something but it suddenly showed as being something and so it ' s important to find those cases , \" said Prof Olesen . What were the changes ? The model of care introduced in Denmark has three routes . First - for patients with \" alarm \" symptoms of specific cancers - there are fast - track diagnosis and treatment routes with strict time targets . In addition to that , by law , any patient with a physical illness in Denmark must be investigated within 30 days of a GP referral . Second , the Danish health service from 2007 set up diagnosis centres - at existing hospitals and clinics - where patients with symptoms which GPs can not diagnose are given a range of tests and scans quickly to find out what is wrong with them , whether it is cancer or something else . GP Dr Hanne Heje , who works in Aarhus - a city slightly smaller than Cardiff - said the new system helps doctors who suspect something is wrong but not necessarily cancer . It also stops the \" ping pong \" between GPs and different specialists . \" Now we know there ' s a department meeting the patient with open arms saying ' we welcome you ' , even though there ' s not a diagnosis written on their forehead , \" she said .

The NAC , which sanctioned the bout , told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday . NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10 oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August . Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing . Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating : \" I ' ll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves . \" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage . Instead , his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed . At the time , NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8 oz gloves at 154lbs before . Rules state that 10 oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8 oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified . \" Even if they are both in agreement , our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters , \" said Bennett . \" To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine . \" During his UFC career , McGregor has used 4 oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather ' s Instagram post last week , stating : \" I am coming sprinting at you with bricks . Brittle hands . \" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision . McGregor , 29 , will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history . The UFC lightweight champion ' s move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather , 40 , has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin . But Bennett says he studied a \" litany of information \" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \" several reasons to approve the fight \" . Bennett said that McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion . \" I spoke to Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward ,

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "38285834", "doc": "The claims against the agricultural commodities trader were made in a report by Mighty , a US - based environmental lobby group . Mighty also accuses Olam and its main stakeholder , Singapore state - owned investment company Temasek , of turning a blind eye to these practices . Both companies reject the allegations . Singapore and Malaysia regularly suffer from haze caused by slash - and - burn practices by small - scale farmers and rogue palm oil traders in Indonesia . Indonesia is often blamed for not doing enough to tackle the agriculture fires used to clear vegetation for palm oil , pulp and paper plantations in the Riau province in East Sumatra , South Sumatra , and parts of Kalimantan on Indonesian Borneo . Singapore - based Olam has confirmed that it buys 99 % of its palm oil from third party suppliers and while it is a relative newcomer to the industry , it says it accounts for less than 1 % of the global market . Mighty ' s report says Olam and Temask could be unwittingly encouraging unsustainable palm oil trading practices that may contribute to the haze that is caused by the fires . It also says Olam created a \" secretive market for rogue palm oil companies \" that allowed the vast majority of its product to be bought from unknown sources . But Olam chief executive Sunny Verghese told the BBC that the firm had a \" very vigorous sourcing policy and we insist that there is zero tolerance for burning , so it ' s a ' no burn - no peat - no deforestation ' compliance policy \" . The company only agreed to release the names of its 14 suppliers on Monday , having previously resisted calls by Mighty to do so . Mr Verghese said he believed the firm ' s current suppliers all met Olam ' s strict requirements , but added that the vetting and verification process would take several more years to complete . He added that producers who do not comply with the company ' s sustainable principles would be removed from its supply chain . Since Temasek is the majority stake holder in Olam , Mighty ' s allegations could link Singapore ' s state fund to the devastating annual haze affecting Singapore , Thailand , Malaysia and Indonesia - if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven . Temasek ' s investment in Olam means that \" the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world ' s black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze , \" the report says .

The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury ' s and South African retailer Steinhoff . Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos . Last month , a £ 1 . 3bn bid from Sainsbury ' s for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff ' s £ 1 . Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia ' s Wesfarmers last month for £ 340 m , leaving Argos as its only remaining business . Total sales at Argos rose 1 . 9 % to £ 515 m in the eight - week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods , such as video games and tablet computers . The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year , bringing the total to 845 . The new openings held back the like - for - like sales total over the period , it added . Chief executive John Walden , who said it had been \" another rather eventful period \" for the company , was pleased with the improvement in Argos ' sales . Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0 . 5 % at 179 . 1p , but have risen more than 80 % this year following Sainsbury ' s interest in Argos . The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a \" world - leading \" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK . Retail analyst Nick Bubb said : \" Home Retail claim that underlying like - for - like sales were broadly flat , once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out . Gross margins were up , however , by 75 basis points and Home Retail ' s year - end net cash was strong . \" Sainsbury ' s had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail , but will be forced to at least match the 175p - a - share all - cash offer from Steinhoff , which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys . However , the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos .

Ms Edwards , an interfaith minister , is now calling on all vets to ensure they heat up the pads correctly and monitor them adequately . The Animal Health Trust confirmed their vets are now using an incubator to heat the pads . A spokesman said : ' We pioneered the use of MRI in animals back in the 1990s and since then we have scanned more than 20 , 000 animals .

Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure , saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805 , home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke ' s Drift . \" This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way , \" he said . \" The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well - loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town . \" Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history , with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century . \" This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history . \" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision , saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales . He also hoped the closure would not damage the town ' s \" thriving \" military tourism industry . Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk . Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected . Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan , Vale of Glamorgan .

People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce . It means an extra £ 2 , 100 a year – £ 17 , 800 rather than £ 15 , 700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact , or who has never married , according to the survey for the Prudential . It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles . The debt of a divorced retiree averages £ 22 , 100 , Prudential ’ s report said , while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers . Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £ 9 , 500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life . By comparison , only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line , yesterday ’ s report said . The impact of divorce on a former spouse ’ s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working . The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up . Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school , worse in their careers after they leave school , to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime , and to suffer worse health . The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult , studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands , wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income , the price of running two homes instead of one , legal costs , and the long - term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches . Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children , a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘ pension - splitting ’ arrangements .

German authorities have asked the US ambassador for \" swift clarification \" . The US National Security Agency ( NSA ) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme . The scale of the agency ' s global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor , Edward Snowden . The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance . The BBC ' s Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine , and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions . German media say the man arrested this week is a 31 - year - old employee of the federal service , the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst . The German federal prosecutor ' s office confirmed the man ' s arrest , but gave no other details . A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest , as had the members of the nine - strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany . \" The matter is serious , it is clear , \" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper , Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money .

Union chairman Gareth Davies , who is also on the Lions ' selection panel , believes the involvement of Welsh coaches will benefit the national team . \" 2017 is a real summer of opportunity for Welsh coaches and should benefit the whole of Welsh rugby in the years ahead , \" he said . \" It is not often that you get the opportunity to develop coaches in different environments . \" Our coaches and players have been invigorated by their Lions experiences on previous campaigns and there is little doubt that a tour of New Zealand will provide the ultimate test and so once again both mentally stimulate and inspire each individual . \"", "summ": "welsh rugby union ( wru ) coaches have appointed martyn mcbryde as their new coaches .", "model_name": "TranS2S", "cut": "val", "error_type": ["intrinsic-entire_sent"], "annotated_span": ["new", "welsh rugby union ( wru ) coaches have appointed martyn mcbryde as their new coaches", "martyn", "coaches"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [8], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [5], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]}, {"V": [16], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]}, {"V": [31], "NP": [28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]}, {"V": [32], "NP": [33]}, {"V": [40], "NP": [28, 29, 30, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]}, {"V": [51], "NP": [52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]}, {"V": [55], "NP": [56, 57]}, {"V": [60], "NP": [61, 62]}, {"V": [63], "NP": [59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65]}, {"V": [68], "NP": [50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 69]}, {"V": [72, 73, 75], "NP": [74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]}, {"V": [80], "NP": [81, 82]}, {"V": [85], "NP": [84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]}, {"V": [89, 90], "NP": [86, 87, 91, 92, 93]}, {"V": [98, 99], "NP": [95, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]}, {"V": [102], "NP": [95, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110]}, {"V": [120, 121], "NP": [113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130]}, {"V": [129], "NP": [122, 130]}, {"V": [134], "NP": [133, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151]}, {"V": [153], "NP": [133, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171]}, {"V": [155], "NP": [133, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171]}, {"V": [157, 158, 160], "NP": [161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171]}, {"V": [174], "NP": [133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179]}, {"V": [187], "NP": [181, 182, 183, 184, 186, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194]}, {"V": [196], "NP": [181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206]}, {"V": [202, 203], "NP": [197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 204, 205, 206]}, {"V": [210], "NP": [209, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218]}, {"V": [220, 221], "NP": [209, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]}, {"V": [234], "NP": [209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 233]}, {"V": [238, 239], "NP": [240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]}, {"V": [243], "NP": [241, 242, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]}, {"V": [247], "NP": [248, 249, 250, 251]}, {"V": [260], "NP": [254, 255, 256, 257, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]}, {"V": [270], "NP": [271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294]}, {"V": [279, 280], "NP": [274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 281, 282, 283]}, {"V": [279, 285, 289, 290], "NP": [274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 286, 287, 293, 294]}, {"V": [279, 285, 289, 292], "NP": [274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 286, 287, 293, 294]}]}

The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit , Roscosmos added . The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year . Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station . The ship is now spinning out of control , NASA said . Even if Russia hadn ' t lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for Progress to burn up re - entering Earth ' s atmosphere - - albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station . According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle , \" After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re - enters the Earth ' s atmosphere . \" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket ' s third stage , Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft ' s systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , NASA said . \" The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , \" the American space agency said in an update . A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled , NASA said in its latest update . \" Docking has been called off for the Progress 59

US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as \" extremely damaging \" to national security , but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance \" horrifying \" . What could the US government see ? According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden , the US National Security Agency ( NSA ) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs , stored data , voice traffic , file transfers and social networking data of individuals . The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon , which included call duration , location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls . How much do the spooks know ? Why every call matters What can you learn from phone records ? According to the documents , Prism also enabled \" backdoor \" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft , Yahoo , Google , Facebook , PalTalk , AOL , Skype , YouTube and Apple . These servers would process and store a vast amount of information , including private posts on social media , web chats and internet searches . All the companies named have denied their involvement , and it is unknown how Prism actually works . National Security Agency ( NSA ) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet can not provide details . \" If we tell the terrorists every way that we ' re going to track them , they will get through and Americans will die , \" he said Some experts question its true powers , with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a \" catflap \" than a \" backdoor \" . \" The spooks may be allowed to use these firms ' servers but only in respect of a named target , \" he said . \" Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard - drive or similar . \" What about data - protection laws ? Different countries have different laws regarding data protection , but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers , what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity .

The 25 - year - old cousin of Princes William and Harry was seen texting on her mobile as she navigated the concrete jungle on Thursday . The British royal , who is currently working in New York , showcased her hipster style for the second day in a row wearing a black bowler hat , black leather top and a black and cream miniskirt . Princess Eugenie , who recently turned 25 , was engrossed in her phone after indulging in some retail therapy at Intermix in New York Topshop striped zip through skirt Earn your style stripes ! Visit site Like the rest of the royals , Princess Eugenie must be counting down the days until the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ' s second baby . But until then , she ' s busy in the Big Apple ! Luckily for our bank balances , Eugenie is a high street gal at heart ( apart from the odd shopping spree at Intermix . . . ) and this is the second time this week we ' ve spotted her wearing affordable pieces . Yesterday it was a Zara biker coat , and this time around it ' s this stripe skirt , which is from Topshop . When teamed with her favorite pork pie hat ( also from Topshop ) and black ankle boots , she ' s got city chic sussed ! And the good news is that emulating Eugenie couldn ' t be easier .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "37838086", "doc": "After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result , Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered . Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third . Extend , yes , but for just one more year . Superficially , it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge . Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to ? Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote ? Or was there another issue weighing on his mind : how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two ? The third , it appears , was the clincher . When Mr Carney took office in 2013 , the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later ( a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation , Pascal Lamy , as something akin to \" taking an egg out of omelette \" ) , was a remote one . But that all changed on 23 June . Beyond trying to stabilise the economy , it also created a personal issue for the Governor . If he left in 2018 as originally agreed , it would be right in the middle of Britain ' s exit negotiations . Should he , therefore , extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve ? That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets . And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed , telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he \" wanted to serve \" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years . But , a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions , he started talking about a \" third way \" - the short extension . The reasons were personal and unique . In 2018 , one of Mr Carney ' s four daughters will be finishing her A - levels , and another will be completing her GCSEs . Like everyone , I have personal circumstances that I have to manage .

In February , Dumfries Sheriff Court heard how most of the images he had downloaded were of young boys partially dressed in erotic poses with no sexual activity . In addition to his payback order he was ordered to take part in a special programme for sex offenders . A GTC Scotland hearing was told that the nature of the offence meant Geaney had \" condoned and participated in an industry that violates and abuses children \" . It heard that his conduct was \" fundamentally incompatible \" with being a registered teacher . The panel found that Geaney had failed to uphold the standards expected of the profession .

Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements . \" Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel ? Yes , \" he was once quoted as saying . And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts . But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process . After the publication of the human genome , Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project : the creation of a synthetic life form . Scientists at the US - based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade . They have now published details of the result , an organism called Synthia , in the prestigious journal Science . Born in 1946 , as a boy , Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California . Three years later , in 1967 , he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict . As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang , he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive . This inspired two important changes in him : a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted . \" Life was so cheap in Vietnam . That is where my sense of urgency comes from , \" he said . During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice . By the 1980s , the early days of the revolution in molecular biology , he was working at the government - funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes . But the work was messy , tedious and agonisingly slow . So , in 1987 , when he read reports of an automated decoding machine , he soon had the first one in his lab . This speeded things up - but not enough . Then came Dr Venter ' s real breakthrough . He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts , because cells already use those parts naturally . He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules ( called RNA ) that a cell makes from that blueprint . He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates . His success shocked some , most notably the co - discoverer of DNA , James Watson", "summ": "` ` maverick\\'\\'is a word that seems to follow craig venter around .", "model_name": "Gold", "cut": "val", "error_type": ["extrinsic-entire_sent"], "annotated_span": ["``maverick\\'\\'is a word that seems to follow craig venter around"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [2], "NP": [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}, {"V": [6], "NP": [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]}, {"V": [8], "NP": [5, 9, 10]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [4], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}, {"V": [8], "NP": [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]}, {"V": [20], "NP": [19]}, {"V": [18, 19, 20, 23], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 24, 25, 26, 27]}, {"V": [32, 33, 34], "NP": [29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]}, {"V": [44], "NP": [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]}, {"V": [56], "NP": [52, 53, 54, 57, 58]}, {"V": [66], "NP": [60, 63, 65, 67, 68]}, {"V": [68], "NP": [60, 63]}, {"V": [72], "NP": [70, 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]}, {"V": [94, 95], "NP": [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]}, {"V": [96], "NP": [85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 98, 99, 100]}, {"V": [112], "NP": [102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 110, 111, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]}, {"V": [133], "NP": [131, 134, 135, 136, 137]}, {"V": [140, 141], "NP": [128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149]}, {"V": [154], "NP": [151, 153, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169]}, {"V": [162], "NP": [160, 161, 163]}, {"V": [171], "NP": [172, 173, 179, 180]}, {"V": [182, 183], "NP": [171, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177, 179, 180, 184, 185]}, {"V": [190], "NP": [187, 188, 189, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204]}, {"V": [192], "NP": [189, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204]}, {"V": [215], "NP": [206, 207, 208, 210, 211, 213, 216, 217, 218, 219]}, {"V": [221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 234], "NP": [233, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]}, {"V": [239], "NP": [238, 240, 241, 242, 243]}, {"V": [246], "NP": [245, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]}, {"V": [256], "NP": [257, 258]}, {"V": [264, 267], "NP": [263, 265]}, {"V": [271], "NP": [270, 272, 273, 274, 275]}, {"V": [278], "NP": [277, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285]}, {"V": [284], "NP": [280, 281, 282, 283, 285]}, {"V": [289], "NP": [277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 288]}, {"V": [296], "NP": [291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]}, {"V": [319], "NP": [303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 317, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329]}, {"V": [324], "NP": [322, 325, 326, 327]}, {"V": [332], "NP": [303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 331, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337]}, {"V": [336], "NP": [337]}, {"V": [342], "NP": [339, 340, 341, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348]}, {"V": [357], "NP": [353, 355, 356, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363]}, {"V": [361], "NP": [362, 363]}, {"V": [362], "NP": [363]}, {"V": [367], "NP": [350, 352, 353, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 365, 366, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373]}, {"V": [376], "NP": [375, 377]}, {"V": [385], "NP": [384, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391]}, {"V": [394], "NP": [393, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417]}, {"V": [398, 399], "NP": [396, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417]}, {"V": [401], "NP": [396, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409]}, {"V": [406], "NP": [396, 407, 408, 409]}, {"V": [414, 417], "NP": [412, 413, 415, 416]}, {"V": [420], "NP": [419, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441]}, {"V": [432], "NP": [433]}, {"V": [438], "NP": [428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 439, 440, 441]}, {"V": [444], "NP": [443, 445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454]}, {"V": [448, 452, 453, 454], "NP": [443, 450, 451]}, {"V": [458], "NP": [456, 457, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]}]}

The spacecraft that lost contact with flight controllers will re - enter the Earth ' s atmosphere in about a week , Roscosmos , the Russian Federal Space Agency , said Wednesday . \" Roscosmos ( the Russian Federal Space Agency ) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re - enter the Earth ' s atmosphere , \" Kelly said from the space station . The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7 , according to Roscosmos . The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit , Roscosmos added . The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year . Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station . The ship is now spinning out of control , NASA said . Even if Russia hadn ' t lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for Progress to burn up re - entering Earth ' s atmosphere - - albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station . According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle , \" After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re - enters the Earth ' s atmosphere . \" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket ' s third stage , Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft ' s systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , NASA said . \" The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , \" the American space agency said in an update . A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled , NASA said in its latest update . \" Docking has been called off for the Progress 59

As far as I can tell it ' s a process the sheep seem well used to . If not exactly enthusiastic , they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation . But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention , that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world . According to Prof Sinclair , the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results . He tells me : \" One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly , and all the cloning work that has gone on since , is : do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they ? \" Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process . Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some \" age - memory \" might be transferred into the next generation . \" That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect , \" says Prof Sinclair . \" A new born clone might look like a lamb , but in terms of

Google paid Â£10 m in UK corporate taxes between 2006 and 2011 . Mr Schmidt said it was up to the government to change its tax system if it wanted companies to pay more taxes . Speaking on BBC Radio 4 ' s Start the Week , he said : \" What we are doing is legal . I ' m rather perplexed by this debate , which has been going in the UK for some time , because I view taxes as not optional . \" I view that you should pay the taxes that are legally required . It ' s not a debate . You pay the taxes . \" If the British system changes the tax laws , then we will comply . If the taxes go up , we will pay more , if they go down , we will pay less . That is a political decision for the democracy that is the United Kingdom . \" Meanwhile , the head of the Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee , Margaret Hodge , has suggested a new committee should be established to oversee the tax arrangements of major firms . She told the Independent newspaper that such a committee could hear evidence from companies in secret , meaning that companies would not be able to hide their tax affairs behind confidentiality rules . Google , most of whose UK sales are routed through Ireland , is one of the multinationals strongly criticised for organising their tax affairs in ways that minimise the amounts they pay in the UK . Last week , European Union leaders agreed to tackle tax avoidance through an \" automatic information exchange between tax authorities \" to monitor the situation . The Google chairman has previously argued that corporate taxes should be levied in the country where it conducts economic activity and takes risks , rather than where products are consumed . He has also called for a debate on international tax reform . \" Politicians - not companies - [ should ] set the rules . When legislators are doing the lobbying and companies are articulating the law as it stands , it ' s a confusing spectacle for everyone , \" he recently wrote in the Observer . \" Our hope is to move the debate forward , with everyone engaged constructively in developing a clearer , simpler system - one in which companies that abide by the law know that the politicians who devised the rules are willing to defend and commend them . \"", "summ": "the head of google\\ 's tax affairs committee has defended the uk\\ 's tax rules , saying they are \" very confident \" the law will end in",

He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online , but always masked . But now , Imran Khawaja , 27 , from Southall , west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria ' s battlefields . Khawaja left the UK last January . He called himself Abu Daigham al - Britani . And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory , he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad . In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but \" thanks to Allah ' s will \" was soon back on the front line . In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight - lifting skills as his brothers - in - arms cheer him on . Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity . The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men , and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would - be recruits back home . Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations , video diaries of their lives and \" through the keyhole \" tours of fighters ' quarters . Shiraz Maher , of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation ( ICSR ) , at Kings College London , has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq . He says : \" The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic , \" he says . \" They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick , well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims . \" They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know .

Smith , now manager of the Endura racing team , trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe . He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong . He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut . \" Didn ' t I see you win the Glasgow - Dunoon race in the ' 80s ? \" Smith , from Paisley and now based in Kent , replied that he had indeed won , aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25 - mile section .

It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years . In Monday ' s telephone call , Mr Kerry \" said China ' s introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative \" , US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said . \" He urged both sides to de - escalate tensions , ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea , and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law . \" Separately , in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister , Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an \" aggressive act \" .

Mr Khan praised the local community spirit but added : \" People are angry and I share that anger . \" Downing Street said that Mrs May ' s visit was made to get a briefing from the emergency services to ensure that they had the resources they needed . But Labour ' s former deputy leader Harriet Harman wrote on Twitter : \" Theresa May should have met Grenfell fire residents . She should have been prepared to listen to them Not OK to speak at them via TV . \" The prime minister has praised the way the local community had supported the residents and praised the \" professionalism and bravery \" of the emergency services . She pledged that the government \" stands ready to provide every assistance \" to the council and emergency services . \" I want to reassure the residents of Grenfell Tower - all of whom are in our thoughts and prayers - that the government will make every effort to make sure that they are re - housed in", "summ": "jeremy corbyn has defended the grenfell tower fire following the grenfell tower

The spacecraft that lost contact with flight controllers will re - enter the Earth ' s atmosphere in about a week , Roscosmos , the Russian Federal Space Agency , said Wednesday . \" Roscosmos ( the Russian Federal Space Agency ) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re - enter the Earth ' s atmosphere , \" Kelly said from the space station . The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7 , according to Roscosmos . The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit , Roscosmos added . The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year . Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station . The ship is now spinning out of control , NASA said . Even if Russia hadn ' t lost contact with the craft , the original plan was for Progress to burn up re - entering Earth ' s atmosphere - - albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station . According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle , \" After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks , the crew refills it with trash , unneeded equipment and wastewater , which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re - enters the Earth ' s atmosphere . \" The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan . But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket ' s third stage , Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft ' s systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , NASA said . \" The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , \" the American space agency said in an update . A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled , NASA said in its latest update . \" Docking has been called off for the Progress 59

It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain ' s own defences . For now though it is the hunt for U33 , not Red October . The German U - boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves . U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions , are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships . Their task , for this exercise , is to try to take out the command ship , the USS Vicksburg , and an oil tanker . When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds . Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg , Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships , including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland , to begin the search . He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity . There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden , Finland and the UK . He says the training \" focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it ' s not theoretical that we might have to do anti - submarine warfare \" . For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy . It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack . Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg , the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope . Down below , in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship , sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors . Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer , admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship . He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines . But when I ask whether they have been Russian , he replies nervously : \" I wouldn ' t want to comment on that , \" before adding : \" In general , we ' re always on the lookout . \" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines , let alone the movements of any potential enemy .

Some of the actors were warned that they wouldn ' t be able to shake off their sulky , angry , teen characters . But when you look at the careers of Dev Patel and Jack O ' Connell for example , they couldn ' t have been more wrong . Kaya Scodelario was one of the longest - serving members of the cast , appearing in series one to four as Effy Stonem . She went on to appear in sci - fi thriller Maze Runner and is now in Australia filming the next instalment of Pirates of The Caribbean with Johnny Depp . Nicholas Hoult was the only member of the main cast who had serious acting experience . He ' d starred in About a Boy with Hugh Grant in 2002 . He has since gone on to play Beast in the X - Men prequels and will soon be seen starring opposite Kristen Stewart in a film called Equals . Dev Patel ' s first job after playing Anwar Kharral in series one and two , took him from London to India and to the Oscars with Slumdog Millionaire . He told Newsbeat , he never would have got that role without Skins . \" My career started off because Danny Boyle ' s daughter was a fan of the show , that is how I got an audition for Slumdog . \" He has two films out in cinemas at the moment , The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with Dame Judi Dench and Chappie , starring alongside Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman . Jack O ' Connell , who played Cook in series three and four , was hand - picked by Angelina Jolie to star in her most recent movie Unbroken . The 24 - year - old also picked up the Rising Star Award at this year ' s Baftas . Fans of Game of Thrones will be familiar with Joe Dempsie and Hannah Murray who play Gendry and Gilly respectively . It is , of course , not unusual for an actor from a British television show to find success in Hollywood films . What is unusual is the amount of stars that were discovered from one single teen drama on a digital channel . So how were the makers of Skins able to spot so many talented young actors ?

Goals from Jamie Cureton and Clevid Dikamona gave them hope after Jay Simpson fired the O ' s into a 2 - 0 lead . But Armand Gnanduillet fired in the winner to relegate Dagenham and keep Orient ' s play - off hopes alive . Dagenham reached the Football League for the first time in their history in 2007 , but they now return to the National League under John Still , the same manager who took the club from the Conference to League One . The Daggers have League Two ' s worst goal difference , and have conceded 20 goals more this season than they had at this point last term . Still ' s side have also struggled in attack , with 40 - year - old striker Jamie Cureton netting nine goals , compared to the 20 he scored as Dagenham finished 14th in the 2014 - 15 campaign . Boss Still , who returned for his third spell at the club in December , told BBC Radio London on Wednesday that he is committed to helping the Daggers gain promotion from the National League next season . Victory leaves Orient two points adrift of the play - off spots and comes four days after player - manager Kevin Nolan was removed from his managerial role .

At the end of the day there ' s nobody bigger than the football club - the fans are the biggest part of the football club . \" We made it a little bit nervy because we gave two sloppy goals away , but in the end that ' s what we need to do now - we need to win games if we ' re going to get into the play - offs . \" Dagenham & Redbridge manager John Still told BBC Radio London : \" I think for half an hour in the first half we lacked organisation and lacked discipline . \" If you haven ' t got organisation and you haven ' t got the discipline to play 90 minutes , the outcome is inevitable . \"

Guzan was said to be hurting after missing out on the semi - final victory over Liverpool , but understood Tim Sherwood ' s decision to keep faith in the competition with the Republic of Ireland goalkeeper . Given ' s performances in the FA Cup have given Sherwood plenty to consider as the Villa manager looks to pick up the points required to stay in the top - flight , beginning with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday evening . Shay Given celebrates Aston Villa ' s 2 - 1 victory against Liverpool in the FA Cup semi - final at Wembley Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzen lost out to Given for the Liverpool clash and is set to lose out again for the final ' Shay comes in every day and trains hard , ' said goalkeeping coach Tony Parks . ' He ' s fully behind Guz when he plays in the league team and he puts pressure on him . If Guz isn ' t playing well then Shay will be back in the team . ' The reverse comes in the cup .

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as ‘ shocking ’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so - called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits . But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers , which he said were ‘ unverified ’ , and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work . The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘ political football ’ . The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming , and by critics to show that when free food is handed out , people will always come forward to take it . Yesterday ’ s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days ’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1 , 084 , 604 . Its UK director Adrian Curtis said : ‘ Despite welcome signs of economic recovery , hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men , women and children . The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK . ’ The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks , with a rise of under 100 , 000 in numbers recorded since 2013 - 14 , when there were 913 , 138 food bank visits . Iain Duncan Smith , pictured , dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust ' s figures are ' unverified ' This figure was almost three times the 2012 - 13 level of 346 , 992 . In 2009 - 10 the Trust recorded 40 , 898 food bank visits . The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three - day food packages , and not numbers of individuals . This means an unknown number make repeat visits , and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million . Research carried out by the Trust , Oxfam , the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks . It found that more than", "summ": "figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and tuc as ‘ shocking ’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so - called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits . but tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned the numbers , which he said were ‘ unverified ’ , and insisted the best way to help families was to get people into work .", "model_name": "PtGen", "cut": "test", "error_type": ["correct"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [6], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "40138740", "doc": "The secretary of state was , by all accounts , a member of the \" Remain Campaign \" lobbying against a US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement . So President Trump ' s \" Climate Brexit \" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not . It was also a blow to the State Department , and to diplomacy . How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this , as on other issues , Tillerson kept a low profile . Twenty - four hours after the decision , the only comment he ' d made was an aside at a photo - opportunity . He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things \" in perspective \" . Tillerson had previously said the US should \" maintain its seat at the table \" on international climate conversations , a sensible position for the nation ' s top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement . But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor , John Kerry , who powered negotiations on the deal . It seems the president ' s daughter , Ivanka , took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers . And the role of super - engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration , Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt , who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony . Mr Tillerson did not attend , whether out of resignation or as an everyday - act - of - resistance , we don ' t know . A State Department official said only that he was in his office and \" maintained his schedule , preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand \" . No doubt Pruitt ( and his ally , White House adviser Steve Bannon ) had an easier task than Tillerson , given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments . But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state . He ' s already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department . And the president ' s son - in - law Jared Kushner , who has even less diplomatic experience than he does , has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House .

She can not give a straight answer to the question . ' But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth , that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "32280676", "doc": "The All Progressives Congress ( APC ) won 19 of the 28 governor posts in results declared from Saturday ' s elections . It is the biggest defeat for the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) since military ruled ended in 1999 . It lost the presidential poll last month for the first time . APC leader Muhammadu Buhari will be inaugurated on 29 May , after he defeated President Goodluck Jonathan . The PDP ' s decline has been reinforced by results from Saturday ' s elections for governors and state assemblies , reports the BBC ' s Bashir Saad Abdullahi from the capital , Abuja . The party lost for the first time in key northern states like Katsina and Kaduna , the home of outgoing Vice - President Namadi Sambo . It also lost control of Adamawa , one of three states badly hit by militant Islamist group Boko Haram ' s insurgency . However , the party managed to hold on to Rivers State , Nigeria ' s oil hub . The PDP won eight governorships , mostly in the south - east . Taraba is the only result still outstanding , while the election in Imo state was declared inconclusive , because the number of spoilt ballot papers was larger than the margin of victory . Elections were not held in seven states . Analysis : Chris Ewokor , BBC Africa , Abuja The APC has made historic gains , relegating the once - powerful PDP to a regional party . The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes , doing well only in the south - east and the oil - rich Niger Delta . Most states in the north went to the APC , along with Nigeria ' s commercial hub , Lagos , in the south - west . However , the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria ' s five oil - producing states . This will be of huge concern to President - elect Muhammadu Buhari , as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much - needed oil revenue . It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants . In parts of the country , the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry , and the battle for power and money .

A record number of 46 . 8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election , 500 , 000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46 . 4 million figure for the EU referendum . Of these , 68 . 7 % actually voted on the day , the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997 . There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline . In total , 2 . 9 million applications were received over the six - week period . Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10 % , including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury , Cambridge , Bristol West and Leeds Central . However , concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year ' s EU referendum - continue to persist . At the moment , there is no direct link between electoral registers , which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain , and the online registration service now used by a majority of people . The two systems use different databases and can not communicate directly with each other .

But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1 . 4 million , suggesting \" a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates \" . With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered , the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30 % and 70 % in different areas .

It said the council tax had built - in problems \" from day one \" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers . The commission , set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla , will report back later this year . Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow , was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world . He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \" good tax \" because it was stable , difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets . But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection . Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income . Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax , used by many countries , was generally perceived as fairer . But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated . There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities . He said : \" It is clear there is no magic bullet . \" Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform . \" So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies , change and reform is a major undertaking . \" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn .

He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers . \" The alternatives are very bad , \" said Mr Thneibat . \" The international community will pay a high price if we don ' t stand together to face this serious problem , \" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum . Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1 . 3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders . \" We ' re trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace , introducing ideas of tolerance and co - existence , \" Mr Thneibat , who is also Jordan ' s education minister , told the international conference in Dubai . But he warned that Syria ' s neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance . He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools , which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145 , 000 refugee children in its state school system . But there were still more children arriving than could be taught , he warned . There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged , Mr Thneibat said - but almost two - thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan ' s own education budget , he said . This was in addition to extra costs in health , housing and infrastructure . Without any access to education , he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict . \" If we leave these students , we believe they could become extremists . \" Tom Fletcher , UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year , said the numbers of refugees were now \" staggering \" . Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis . He said conventional humanitarian crisis approaches did not work on this scale , and that other groups , including business , should contribute . George Papendreou , former prime minister of Greece , told the conference that he had been a refugee when his family was in political exile . He said that European countries should try to see refugees as potential benefits to their societies rather than respond with \" fear and ignorance \" .", "summ": "the head of the international

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "37680168", "doc": "The regulator , NHS Improvement , said it wanted more progress after the NHS had slipped behind schedule in its efforts to reduce the agency bill . Last year £ 3 . 6bn was spent on agency staff , but the regulator wants that brought down by £ 1bn by the end of this financial year . A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £ 600 m , the regulator said . It means hospitals , mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55 % above normal shift rates for any staff , from doctors and nurses to administration staff . Only senior managers are exempted . The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them . Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs , such as National Insurance contributions , when it buys them in . NHS Improvement said the progress being made was \" promising \" , but it still leaves the NHS short . The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10 % down on where they wanted to be . And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen . The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS \" bank \" staff - effectively the health service ' s in - house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime . NHS Improvement said it would start publishing \" league tables \" of the best and worst - performing trusts on agency spending later this year . Information on the 20 highest - earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work . It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors . In one case a trust was quoted £ 130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £ 76 , while another was quoted £ 70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £ 35 . NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said : \" The NHS simply doesn ' t have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff .

ICT captain Gary Warren was dismissed for two bookable offences in quick succession after the break , leading to Murray Davidson firing in a second . Danny Swanson broke neatly into the box and killed off Caley Thistle in the final 10 minutes with a low finish . Inverness , now propping up the league table , have conceded more goals than any other side in the Premiership . Their rearguard were all lured to the ball for the opening goal . Good play from MacLean drew in a posse of defenders before he played in Craig to deftly finish from the edge of the box . When skipper Warren was sent - off you feared the worst for Inverness . His first yellow was for persistent fouling . His second came soon after for a foul on Swanson as the forward skipped past him . The resultant free - kick led to Davidson doubling the Saints lead . Injuries have not helped Caley Thistle ' s cause at the back - Ross Draper was forced to play centre - back - but boss Richie Foran must be concerned about the porous nature of his defence . St Johnstone had lost three of their four home games ahead this match . Manager Tommy Wright knew it was vital his side stopped conceding poor goals . It was better in the first half . Often Inverness got to the St Johnstone box only to be rebuffed by a ring of light blue steel that resulted in the visitors barely getting a sniff of goal . Overall Inverness looked toothless but credit to St Johnstone for looking more like their resolute selves . There was a swagger about Wright ' s side after they opened the scoring , but they had to wait until the second half to increase their lead . They might have had a penalty when Richard Foster went down in the box under challenge . It looked a bit soft and referee Euan Anderson waved it away . St Johnstone deserved another goal , though , and it came after Warren ' s dismissal , Davidson finding the bottom corner from the ricocheted free - kick . Swanson added the icing to the cake with a third goal 10 minutes from time , as Saints sealed an utterly deserved victory . St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright : \" We started on the front foot , got the goal , then after the first and second goals we dropped off a little bit .

It also comes ahead of a speech on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict by US Secretary of State John Kerry . On Friday , the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction . The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu , whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had \" ironclad information \" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and \" pushed hard \" for its passage . A US state department spokesman said the accusation was \" just not true \" , but he hoped the resolution would \" serve as a wake - up call \" for Israel . More than 500 , 000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel ' s 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem . The settlements are considered illegal under international law , though Israel disputes this . The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements \" has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two - state solution and a just , lasting and comprehensive peace \" . Israel rejected the resolution , and the BBC ' s Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital , but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state . Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution , recalling Israel ' s ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal , cutting aid to Senegal , and cancelling a visit by Ukraine ' s prime minister . The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot . But on Wednesday , planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed . Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister ' s office , to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry ' s speech . \" It ' s in our interest to avoid political voting in Jerusalem because Jerusalem is not the same as settlements around Israel , \" he said . \" We are creating affordable housing and housing for young families . . . and if there is a big storm and Kerry ' s speech today , we are looking to avoid this conflict . \" Mr Kerry is expected to lay out his vision later on", "summ": "the us has vetoed a un resolution against

This is the lowest number of recorded homicide cases for a single 12 - month period since 1976 and half the figure of nine years ago . As of 31 March 2016 , only one case of homicide recorded in 2015 - 16 was unresolved . The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51 % of homicides ( 29 cases ) in 2015 - 16 . Nearly all of these cases ( 26 out of 29 ) involved a knife . While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs , 31 % ( 20 people ) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs . Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said : \" While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long - term decline in violent crime , the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue , because each of the lives lost is one life too many . \" There is a clear role across a range of public services , in addition to the critical work of our police , to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so - called ' casual ' violence . \" We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime , while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others . \" Scottish Labour ' s justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said : \" Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution . \" Last year when the Scottish government were heralding ' record low ' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop , the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase . \" Meanwhile , sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45 - year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27 % . \" The number of homicide victims for 2014 - 15 stood at 59 last year but later increased

The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness .

She said Peta ' s suggestion would give the resort an opportunity to rebrand itself as a progressive holiday destination . \" One where the mutilation and killing of sea animals is not being celebrated . \" Skegness ' s mayor , Carl Macey , said the Jolly Fisherman was loved by adults and children alike .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "38328811", "doc": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \" genocide \" and \" ethnic cleansing , \" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world ' s youngest country . Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan , 340 , 000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda . That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200 , 000 people have fled Syria in 2016 . Every day , on average , another 2 , 500 South Sudanese become refugees , and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way , add to the evidence of killing , rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines . Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia . A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres . The first time he crossed was with his immediate family ; the second - a day later - was with his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help . Six - year - old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road . I asked him what they had left behind . \" They are killing people , sleeping with wives , stealing . They are not shooting you , they are cutting you with a knife . Even small children can be beaten down , \" Mr Thomas told me . The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun . \" They don ' t want us , \" he said , and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei , just 80 km ( 50 miles ) from the border , had become a place he had to leave . \" These tribes of Dinka , they don ' t want Equatorians , they don ' t want … Nuer . They don ' t want them . \" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan .

By the late 2000s , this area had fallen to about 275 sq km . The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) Fall Meeting , the world ' s largest annual gathering of Earth scientists . It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations , but predominantly Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , Germany , France , and Italy . The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent , from the University of Savoie , and colleagues . It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins , Belledonne , Vanoise , Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs , as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north . The team drew upon map archives , past satellite imagery and aerial photographs . Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct . \" We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier , \" explained Ms Gardent . \" Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there . Also , deep shadows can hide the glacier margins . \" The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory . It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km . By 1985 - 86 , in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s / early 80s , glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km , the new survey shows . Since then , the withdrawal has accelerated , with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s . This represents an average loss of some 26 % over the last 40 years . The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps , however . The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors .

That would be enough to build 80 , 000 to 170 , 000 social homes , the report said . Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \" driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods \" was not the answer . In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report , Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart . Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director , told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal , but there would just be \" less of it \" . \" The truth is I don ' t believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town . \" People do have a right to get housed , just not in the very most expensive areas , \" he said . He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing , currently around 1 . 8 million , could be reduced by about 500 , 000 if the scheme was implemented . The prime minister ' s official spokesman said : \" This is something that councils can choose to do already . \" Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can . The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years . \" They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently . \" If they can sell high - value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people , then that is certainly something they should look at . \" But Labour said the coalition ' s \" failed \" polices were \" making the housing crisis worse not better \" . Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said : \" Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes , breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods . \" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250 , 000 affordable homes and \" put unemployed builders back to work \" and boost the construction industry .

The hosts also lost starting strikers Abel Hernandez and Will Keane to first - half injuries to compound the frustration of their fans , but the mood inside the KCOM Stadium was transformed in the space of two second - half minutes . First , Snodgrass - introduced from the bench for the stricken Keane - swept home his fourth league goal of the season from Sam Clucas ' low cross before the Scotland international delivered an inviting free - kick that Michael Dawson headed past Fraser Forster . Southampton pushed for an equaliser but David Marshall made a string of saves in the Hull goal before Clucas produced a remarkable goalline clearance from a corner in the final minute of added time . The win - Hull ' s first in the league since 20 August - ends a six - game losing streak , although they remain inside the bottom three heading into the international break . Media playback is not supported on this device The best that could be said for the early loss of Hull ' s strikers was that it gave an opportunity for Snodgrass to return earlier than expected after missing the past two matches with an ankle injury . But his entrance from the bench following Keane ' s injury midway through the first half did not appear to be asking too much of the Tigers ' top scorer - far from it . Instantly the hosts appeared to have greater urgency with the 29 - year - old on the pitch , having looked sluggish and uninspired for 26 minutes before his introduction . The mood inside the stadium at kick - off was exactly what could be expected of a club bidding to avoid a seventh straight league defeat for the first time in 36 years . That run of defeats - during which 20 goals had been shipped - allied to widespread unhappiness among fans over the Allam family ' s running of the club meant the KCOM Stadium had a threadbare look at kick - off , with an official attendance of just 17 , 768 . Empty seats dotted a ground that used to be filled to the rafters in the second and third tiers , and the dark mood of many home fans in attendance can not have been lost on the players . Yet Snodgrass ' tireless running lifted not only the fans but his team - mates , and his well - taken 61st - minute goal followed moments later by a perfect assist for Dawson was just reward for his endeavour .

For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation ' s biggest newspapers . Ex - Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a \" very , very important place \" through which most of the public received its information . The first British daily newspaper , the Daily Courant , was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702 . At its height , \" the Street of Shame \" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist ' s career , with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half - mile radius . Mr Smith , 43 , worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years . He is quick to point out that the paper ' s London address is the same as Sweeney Todd ' s barber shop , where the fictional character took a razor to his clients ' throats . Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here , he says it was announced too soon by some of London ' s tour guides . \" I was standing by the window once a few years ago , and a tour bus had stopped outside . I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here . \" I stuck my head out and shouted : ' We are still here ' . \" The street was famous for its many bars and pubs , constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories , and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women . He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill - fitting jacket , provided by the staff . \" There is so much history here , and to be one of the last ones , I feel unworthy of the torch that I ' m carrying . \" Mr Sherriff , 54 , has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years , and rose to become the Post ' s London chief reporter . He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke - filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about . \" The phones didn ' t even work properly , I ' d be amazed if I called someone

The study , by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin , looked at 4 , 600 workers . It found \" no support \" for the \" reticent female \" theory , whereby women avoided asking for more money . For what it claimed was the first time , the study eliminated any impact from part - time workers earning less than their full - time counterparts , by comparing full - time males with full - time females , and part - time males with part - time females . When like - for - like male and female workers were compared , men were 25 % more likely to get a pay rise when they asked , the study found . The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss , or deviating from a perceived female stereotype . When analysing the results , the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry , whether the workers were a parent , as well as their qualifications . The study was based on data from the 2013 - 14 Australian workplace relations survey . Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise , and why they had or had not done so . Andrew Oswald , professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick , said he was surprised by the findings . \" The fact that women don ' t ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory . It ' s a very common thing for women to say and believe , but all of the evidence is anecdotal , so it ' s very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this . \" He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise , but did not get it , kept it to themselves , while women \" were more straightforward and tell their friends \" . \" Having seen these findings , I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women , \" Prof Oswald added . \" It could be that Australia is odd . But it ' s a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US , so I think that ' s unlikely . \" The study also found differences according to age , with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate , which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "40883148", "doc": "The former five - weight world champion submitted a necessary waiver to the Nevada Athletic Commission ( NAC ) on Wednesday , hours before the deadline . The NAC , which sanctioned the bout , told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday . NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10 oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August . Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing . Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating : \" I ' ll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves . \" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage . Instead , his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed . At the time , NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8 oz gloves at 154lbs before . Rules state that 10 oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8 oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified . \" Even if they are both in agreement , our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters , \" said Bennett . \" To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine . \" During his UFC career , McGregor has used 4 oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather ' s Instagram post last week , stating : \" I am coming sprinting at you with bricks . Brittle hands . \" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision . McGregor , 29 , will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history . The UFC lightweight champion ' s move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather , 40 , has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin . But Bennett says he studied a \" litany of information \" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \" several reasons to approve the fight \" . Bennett said that McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion . \" I spoke to Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward , \" said Bennett . \" He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer", "summ": "floyd mayweather has formally requested to use 8 oz gloves when he fights

A search of a site in Chapelizod in Dublin started early on Saturday morning , Irish national broadcaster , RTÉ reports . The area is three acres of Woodlands beside the R112 which runs down to the River Liffey . Gardaí said the search will involve excavations and is expected to take a number of weeks . Earlier this year a team of six detectives began conducting a complete review of Mr Deely ' s disappearance . CCTV footage from the night he went missing was enhanced using specialist technology . It shows Mr Deely talking to a man dressed in black outside the Bank of Ireland on Baggot Street , where he worked . It is understood he was returning to get an umbrella after the party .
