Under the proposal , which had already passed a first round of voting , it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could \" destroy , alter or subvert state institutions \" or \" damage national integrity or independence \" . This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook , or receiving an email containing anti - government sentiment , could have faced up to 12 years in prison . The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos , pictures or recordings without the subject ' s consent , criminalise \" whistle - blowing \" under the crime of \" espionage \" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state , even if it was not classified . Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital , Luanda , that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision . But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists , who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was \" totalitarian \" and violated basic freedom of expression , played a role in the decision to abandon the law . US - based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have \" undercut both freedom of expression and information , and posed a severe threat to independent media , whistle - blowers , and investigative journalism \" . With most of Angola ' s traditional media controlled by the state , or owned by government ministers and their business associates , there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio . Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time , while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin . Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet , even though only 1 % of Angolans have access to the web , to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites . In recent months , several anti - government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook , where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years , Jose Eduardo dos Santos . There , people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public . Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online , creating websites to rally support for regime change , and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa , the UK and Belgium . Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country ' s oil wealth among", "summ": "in a rare climbdown , the angolan government has withdrawn controversial

While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions , Raheem Sterling ’ s interview didn ’ t go down well at all . It was ill - timed and , regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped , he didn ’ t come across very well . Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really . I ’ m hoping that that wasn ’ t the whole point , as we ’ ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before . The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him . There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion : ‘ let him go ’ . Obviously , with the caveat that we get our money ’ s worth ! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend ' s game with Arsenal . It ’ s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned , but there ’ s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation , considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout . Personally , I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £ 100 , 000 - a - week contract he ’ s turned down . But it ’ s only that : potential . At present , he ’ s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but , obviously at his age , he ’ s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form . He hasn ’ t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd . Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4 - 0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I ’ d be willing to see the club give him £ 100k a week – possibly £ 120k a week - the club shouldn ’ t do everything it can to keep him .

The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger - - not a male - - was walking through . And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area , prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger , police said , citing a TSA investigation . But during the patdown , the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger ' s front groin area and buttocks , which violates TSA policy . Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November . The agency launched an investigation , and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question , Denver police said in a report . Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9 . He interviewed the female TSA officer , who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times , police said . Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired , TSA special agent Charles Stone told police . Authorities did not release their names .

It has also highlighted a gaping hole in Britain ' s own defences . For now though it is the hunt for U33 , not Red October . The German U - boat is acting as the unseen enemy below the waves . U33 ' s commander Kai Nicklesdorf and his 28 crew , who live in cramped conditions , are trying to avoid detection by 10 Nato warships . Their task , for this exercise , is to try to take out the command ship , the USS Vicksburg , and an oil tanker . When they dive the only visible sign of their presence will be the brief sight of a periscope breaking the waves for a matter of seconds . Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg , Rear Admiral Brad Williamson prepares his fleet of 10 warships , including the Royal Navy Frigate HMS Portland , to begin the search . He says this is important training and that his crews are all aware of Russian submarine activity . There have been recent reports of Russian submarines off the coast of Sweden , Finland and the UK . He says the training \" focuses our minds and for the guys in combat it ' s not theoretical that we might have to do anti - submarine warfare \" . For the surface ships the task of locating an invisible enemy under vast stretches of ocean is not that easy . It has been likened to looking for a needle in a haystack . Up on the bridge of the USS Vicksburg , the crew scan the horizon looking out for a periscope . Down below , in a darkened room in the bowels of the ship , sailors listen in and monitor the results from the ships sonar and sensors . Lieutenant Colin Ryan , Vicksburg ' s anti - submarine warfare officer , admits that it is much easier for a submarine to hide than a surface ship . He says there have been incidents on this deployment when they have identified submarines . But when I ask whether they have been Russian , he replies nervously : \" I wouldn ' t want to comment on that , \" before adding : \" In general , we ' re always on the lookout . \" Nato members rarely comment on the activities of their own submarines , let alone the movements of any potential enemy . But this exercise is proof there is growing concern about Russia ' s increasing military strength .

Scroll down for video Grim discovery : Street cleaners who found the remains initially feared they had stumbled across a murder victim It is thought to have been stolen from the archaeological site known as Chan Chan which was the capital of the Chimu Empire , an urban civilisation that appeared on the Peruvian coast around 1100 AD . The discovery was made in the early hours of the morning as the cleaners swept up the streets close to the dig . Cleaner Otilio Padilla Miramontes , 54 , said : ' It looked just like any other box dumped on the streets . Well preserved : It turned out the ' victim ' was in fact a stolen , 915 - year - old Peruvian mummy Forensics : Police were called by the cleaners who made the discovery by an archaeological dig site in Trujillo Wrapped up : The mummified remains were discovered in a box , wrapped in rope , by cleaners in Peru ' But when I opened it I nearly died of heart attack as I saw this grinning skull staring up at me . ' I had no idea it was an ancient mummy , I thought it was someone who had been murdered so I immediately called the police . ' A police spokesman said : ' We quickly established that this was not a recent skeleton . ' But we are now investigating how it ended up in a box outside of the main archaeological site . ' Our suspicion is that someone tried to steal it and had maybe left it in the box to collect later . ' The remains were taken to the regional Directorate of Culture for examination . A spokesman there said : ' This is not a Chimu mummy and is most likely pre - Hispanic suggesting it is from another culture pre - dating the Hispanic arrival .

And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber : \" It ' s goodbye from me . . . for now \" . Ms Marwick , Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May . Mr Salmond , who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014 , used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was \" not divided , but diverse \" . He said both the country and parliament were on a journey , and added : \" Yes we are a country of different views , but we are not divided . There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland . \" And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that \" . He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill , but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign . There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond , who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget , joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a \" major attraction down south today \" . He then added : \" However , on balance , I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks . \" And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck , \" albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm \" . He concluded his address by saying : \" Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament . \" There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland . There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country . \" And so with that it is goodbye from me . . . for now \" . Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister , and added that he had \" served the parliament and Scotland with distinction \" . The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil , who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it

Fears were raised over a planned murder bid involving police being ambushed after reports of a non - existent crime . Hughes admitted two charges at Mold Crown Court on Friday . He will be sentenced next week . Hughes said he was planning to make a false report to the police so that officers would come to the scene , prosecutors said while outlining the case earlier in the proceedings . He said he would then shoot them on the Dee Estuary . The threats were made on two occasions , late at night , while Hughes was drunk . Judge Niclas Parry , who was told the defendant had a previous conviction for possessing a firearm in 2009 , remanded him in custody pending sentence .

APP has been named by Singapore authorities as one of the companies suspected of contributing to the haze . What is behind the South East Asia haze ? In a joint statement , the Singapore Environment Council ( SEC ) and Consumers Association of Singapore ( CASE ) said they had asked the retailers to declare that they have \" not procured or used wood , paper and / or pulp materials \" from firms accused of contributing to the fires . The SEC said retailers were \" a good starting point \" for firms to show their commitment to sustainable procurement processes and \" for consumers to show their support for brands that have environmentally friendly practices \" The haze has caused hazardous air quality across the region . It has led to the cancellation of public events and schools closure over the past month , in Singapore as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia .

His survival is unusual , as experts say it ' s rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster . The man , Rishi Khanal , was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu , the capital , around noon Tuesday , said Pushparam K . C . , a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal . The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life , he said . But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out , the spokesman said . A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal ' s location and then hauling him up through the hole . They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher . On Wednesday afternoon , Khanal , 27 , had just undergone surgery and was resting , surrounded by family and friends . He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience . \" It seems he survived by sheer willpower , \" said Akhilesh Shrestha , a doctor who treated Khanal , according to the Reuters news agency . Khanal ' s story of survival isn ' t the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake , which has killed more than 5 , 000 people . A 4 - month - old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck , the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported . A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard , the newspaper said . The little boy , whose name is Sonit Awal , was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries , according to initial examinations . CNN hasn ' t independently confirmed Sonit ' s rescue , but the newspaper published photos showing the dust - caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure . Tanka Maya Sitoula , a 40 - year - old mother of four , was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city , bringing the five - story building down around her ground - floor apartment .

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised . The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the Argentine ' s tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration . Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century . Remember THAT title - winning goal against QPR in 2012 ? Most , in that situation , would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli . The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club ' s long history . That calm head , that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £ 38 m for in 2011 . Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five - year deal only last August . However , he now has to think of himself . If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage ? There are admirers . Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans . Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep", "summ": "manchester city striker sergio aguero looks as outdated as a commodore 64 . but the argentine 's tremendous

which rises to £ 750 m if you include its own underspend . \" The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £ 30bn . \" One look at the current oil price tells you this is a

Speaking to BBC Sunday Politics London Ben Plowden , of Transport for London , said the Olympics showed it was possible to achieve a very significant change in when and how deliveries take place . \" Something like a fifth of freight activity moved out of the busiest times in the day and that was because we worked closely with the boroughs and the councils , the freight industry and the supermarkets and other people to make that happen , \" he said . \" So what that shows is you can make a big change , the question is how do you make that part of everyday life rather than a one - off thing for the Olympics ? \" Catherine West , head of transport on London Councils , said a balance was needed so that Londoners could get a good night ' s sleep . \" A lot of people live on busy roads and they live above shops . We just have to be mindful that a lorry delivery at 4 am may not be great for residents , \" she said .", "summ": "the sister of a cyclist who was killed in east london last week has urged witnesses to contact police .", "model_name": "Gold", "cut": "test", "error_type": ["extrinsic-NP"], "annotated_span": ["last week", "east"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [7], "NP": [3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]}, {"V": [14], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18]}, {"V": [17], "NP": [15, 18]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [2], "NP": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]}, {"V": [6], "NP": [3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14]}, {"V": [21], "NP": [16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]}, {"V": [35], "NP": [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]}, {"V": [42], "NP": [36, 37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]}, {"V": [52], "NP": [49, 50, 51, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70]}, {"V": [57], "NP": [56, 58]}, {"V": [62], "NP": [61, 63]}, {"V": [55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 66], "NP": [65, 67]}, {"V": [55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 63, 69], "NP": [65, 70]}, {"V": [75], "NP": [73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]}, {"V": [80], "NP": [81, 82, 83, 84, 85]}, {"V": [90], "NP": [87, 88, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]}, {"V": [94], "NP": [92, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]}, {"V": [103], "NP": [87, 88, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114]}, {"V": [110], "NP": [87, 88, 111, 112, 113, 114]}, {"V": [125, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132], "NP": [116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122]}, {"V": [131], "NP": [127, 128, 129, 132]}, {"V": [144], "NP": [134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155]}, {"V": [149], "NP": [146, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155]}, {"V": [154], "NP": [146, 155]}, {"V": [164], "NP": [157, 159, 160, 161, 162, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189]}, {"V": [191], "NP": [192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203]}, {"V": [205], "NP": [191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224]}, {"V": [208], "NP": [206, 207, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224]}, {"V": [210], "NP": [211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224]}, {"V": [213], "NP": [214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224]}, {"V": [223], "NP": [219, 220, 221, 222, 224]}, {"V": [234], "NP": [227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]}, {"V": [245], "NP": [244, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]}, {"V": [248, 249], "NP": [247, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269]}, {"V": [267], "NP": [247, 268, 269]}, {"V": [269], "NP": [268]}, {"V": [273], "NP": [227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 272]}, {"V": [279], "NP": [277, 278]}, {"V": [280], "NP": [277, 278, 279, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]}, {"V": [282, 283], "NP": [281, 284, 285, 286]}, {"V": [290], "NP": [288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309]}, {"V": [291, 294], "NP": [293, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309]}, {"V": [322], "NP": [312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337]}, {"V": [326], "NP": [323, 324, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337]}, {"V": [330, 331], "NP": [329, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337]}, {"V": [344], "NP": [340, 341, 342, 343, 345, 346, 347]}, {"V": [350], "NP": [349, 351, 352]}, {"V": [355, 356], "NP": []}, {"V": [358], "NP": [354, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]}, {"V": [367, 368, 369], "NP": [361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 370, 371, 372]}, {"V": [376], "NP": [354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 375]}]}

Those qualities must have been there in the man . \" The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O ' Brien , and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra ' s home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months . Regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time , Mozart wrote more than 600 works , including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music , before he died at the age of 35 . Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime , but many are stylised or incomplete . The best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi , for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni . \" Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent - minded young man , but not without a certain spirit of pride , \" he said . \" He was very popular with the ladies , in spite of his small size ; but he had a most unusual face , and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes . \" Describing the existing portraits as \" cosy and pretty \" , O ' Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting . \" I know of few musicians of real depth where you can ' t see some of that complexity in the face . So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven , who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts , I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration . \" Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger . Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance , and I related to those for Mozart . \" O ' Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine , which was inspired by U2 singer Bono .

War , is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine . But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends . Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine , arguing that any Russians serving there are \" volunteers \" .

There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident . \" The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals , not separatists , who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine .

That would be enough to build 80 , 000 to 170 , 000 social homes , the report said . Labour said new homes were urgently needed but \" driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods \" was not the answer . In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report , Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart . Neil O ' Brien , the think tank ' s director , told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal , but there would just be \" less of it \" . \" The truth is I don ' t believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town . \" People do have a right to get housed , just not in the very most expensive areas , \" he said . He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing , currently around 1 . 8 million , could be reduced by about 500 , 000 if the scheme was implemented . The prime minister ' s official spokesman said : \" This is something that councils can choose to do already . \" Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can . The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years . \" They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently . \" If they can sell high - value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people , then that is certainly something they should look at . \" But Labour said the coalition ' s \" failed \" polices were \" making the housing crisis worse not better \" . Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said : \" Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes , breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard - working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods . \" He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250 , 000 affordable homes and \" put unemployed builders back to work \" and boost the construction industry .

And Greece ' s resorts are teeming : Athens airport expects 25 million arrivals this year , up from 21 million ; the incremental 4 million are not all eurozone and IMF officials intent on turning the country into a protectorate run from Brussels , Frankfurt and Washington ( home of the IMF ) .

Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain â ‚ ¬86bn of new credit from the eurozone and ( well maybe ) the IMF , in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country . Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year . Presumably the explanation is that Greece ' s near - death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA ( \" there is no alternative \" ) . What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular , in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal ( tax and spending ) austerity . Worse , his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too : the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend . Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment , but if retailers and wholesalers can ' t get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad , Christmas will be cancelled ( 70 % of shops ' orders are placed in September and October , bankers tell me ) .

The accumulation , as I like to call it , includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry . Within this rapidly growing accumulation , I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach . My recent exhibition , titled \" Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell \" , features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry . I exhibited 5 , 000 labels from my collection of 25 , 000 . AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur . It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat ( also known as Cambay ) in Gujarat state , and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two . The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries . Ambarnath , written in Hindi on this label , was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state . Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long . This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands . This label promoted the Swadeshi ( self - reliance ) movement during the partition of India ' s Bengal region in 1905 . A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods . Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands . Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India ' s struggle for freedom . Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement . It ' s believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule . Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today . Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s . Some labels even featured Pakistani films . Actors and film posters continue to be featured on matchboxes today .", "summ": "i have been collecting matchboxes seriously since 2012 .", "model_name": "Gold", "cut": "val", "error_type": ["extrinsic-NP"], "annotated_span": ["seriously since 2012"], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [3, 5], "NP": [0, 4, 6, 7]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [2], "NP": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]}, {"V": [22, 23], "NP": [21, 24]}, {"V": [31], "NP": [30, 32, 33, 34]}, {"V": [33], "NP": [30, 34]}, {"V": [36], "NP": [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]}, {"V": [41], "NP": [40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]}, {"V": [50, 51], "NP": [52]}, {"V": [56], "NP": [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65]}, {"V": [63], "NP": [62, 64, 65]}, {"V": [68], "NP": [67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]}, {"V": [69, 72], "NP": [70, 71, 73, 74, 75]}, {"V": [81], "NP": [77, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90]}, {"V": [89], "NP": [86, 87, 88]}, {"V": [92], "NP": [77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]}, {"V": [98], "NP": [93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105]}, {"V": [108], "NP": [107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119]}, {"V": [123], "NP": [121, 122, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]}, {"V": [129], "NP": [124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 130, 131]}, {"V": [130], "NP": [124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 131]}, {"V": [134], "NP": [133, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]}, {"V": [146, 147], "NP": [144, 148, 149]}, {"V": [156], "NP": [133, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165]}, {"V": [158], "NP": [133, 159, 160]}, {"V": [169], "NP": [167, 168, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174]}, {"V": [178, 179, 180], "NP": [176, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [185], "NP": [176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196]}, {"V": [202], "NP": [198, 199, 200, 201, 203, 204]}, {"V": [208, 209], "NP": [206, 210]}, {"V": [216], "NP": [212, 213, 214, 215, 217, 218]}, {"V": [219, 220], "NP": [212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225]}, {"V": [229], "NP": [227, 228, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248]}, {"V": [255], "NP": [250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]}, {"V": [263], "NP": [261, 264, 265, 266, 267]}, {"V": [265], "NP": [266, 267]}, {"V": [271], "NP": [269, 270, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]}, {"V": [275], "NP": [269, 270, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]}, {"V": [288], "NP": [282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297]}, {"V": [301, 302], "NP": [299, 300, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309]}, {"V": [305], "NP": [303, 304, 306, 307, 308, 309]}, {"V": [314], "NP": [315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]}, {"V": [319], "NP": [316, 317, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336]}, {"V": [340], "NP": [338, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357]}, {"V": [347, 348], "NP": [345, 349, 350, 351]}, {"V": [355], "NP": [353, 354, 356, 357]}, {"V": [363], "NP": [359, 360, 361, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368]}, {"V": [372, 373], "NP": [370, 371, 374, 375]}, {"V": [381], "NP": [382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387]}, {"V": [384], "NP": [377, 378, 379, 380, 385, 386, 387]}]}

The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice - cream but the Argentine ' s tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration . Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century . Remember THAT title - winning goal against QPR in 2012 ? Most , in that situation , would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli . The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club ' s long history . That calm head , that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain £ 38 m for in 2011 . Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five - year deal only last August . However , he now has to think of himself . If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage ? There are admirers . Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans . Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep", "summ": "manchester city beat qpr 1 - 0 at old trafford on sunday . sergio aguero scored 100 goals for manchester city

This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re - tested - but kept her world title . \" She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use , \" Minichiello said . Russian anti - doping agency punished Chernova with a two - year ban , backdated to 22 June 2013 .

Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken . Minichiello wants athletics ' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti - Doping Agency ( Wada ) to have a \" long , hard look \" at the Russian anti - doping agency ' s punishment . The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action . \" Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti - doping code which allows only a two - year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re - test , \" added Minichiello . \" I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time . Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective . \" Chernova ' s backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June , and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August , she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics . \" It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them , \" said Minichiello . \" That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked .

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as ‘ shocking ’ evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so - called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits . But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers , which he said were ‘ unverified ’ , and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work . The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a ‘ political football ’ . The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks – said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming , and by critics to show that when free food is handed out , people will always come forward to take it . Yesterday ’ s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days ’ worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1 , 084 , 604 . Its UK director Adrian Curtis said : ‘ Despite welcome signs of economic recovery , hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men , women and children . The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK . ’ The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks , with a rise of under 100 , 000 in numbers recorded since 2013 - 14 , when there were 913 , 138 food bank visits . Iain Duncan Smith , pictured , dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust ' s figures are ' unverified ' This figure was almost three times the 2012 - 13 level of 346 , 992 . In 2009 - 10 the Trust recorded 40 , 898 food bank visits . The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three - day food packages , and not numbers of individuals . This means an unknown number make repeat visits , and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million . Research carried out by the Trust , Oxfam , the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks .

The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £ 390 m more in spending available to them next year . Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016 - 17 spending plans on Wednesday . The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month ' s spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12 . 5 % lower in real terms by 2019 - 20 than it was in 2010 - 11 . Mr Swinney said 4 . 2 % of that reduction would come between now and 2019 - 20 . He said : \" The chancellor ( George Osborne ) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020 , and more than £ 1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade . \" We have demonstrated that the UK government didn ' t have to take this approach . Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor . \" Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor ' s decision . We face tough choices in the coming days . \" Against this backdrop , the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on . \" Mr Swinney said schools , hospitals and the police service in Scotland would \" not be sacrificed to the chancellor ' s austerity obsession \" . He added : \" In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland . More police , lower crime , better schools , tuition - free university education and a health budget that is at a record level . \" These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government . \" Responding to Mr Swinney comments , a spokesman for the UK government ' s Scotland Office said : \" The Scottish government will have £ 390 m more spending available to it next year , which rises to £ 750 m if you include its own underspend . \" The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £ 30bn . \" One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government . \" The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers

The viral clip shows the 23 - year - old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club . Joking that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother , nine - year - old Frankie , who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club , took to the garden to have a go . He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time . In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob - smacked as he places his hands behind his head . A slow motion look at the clip captures the trajectory of the ball , which bounces off the backboard and goes through the hoop below . His mother Lucy , 32 , of Upminster , east London , said : ‘ He loves football and after he saw the Barcelona player do the show he said ‘ I ’ ll be able to do that ’ . Frankie decided to have a go at the trick shot after watching Barcelona star Martin Montoya pull it off in a video recorded at the club ’ s Ciutat Esportiva training ground The nine - year - old kicks the ball and sends it straight through the net on the first time of trying just like Spanish right - back Montoya The gob - smacked youngsters places his hands behind his head after scoring while Montoya ( right ) wheels away in celebration ‘ Me and my mum just said ‘ really ? ’ and he went to get the net , pulled it over and bang - it went in first time . ‘ Me and mum were like ‘ oh my god ’ we couldn ’ t believe it . ‘ He is very good at football , but that was just amazing . It was very special . ’ According to Lucy , although not captured on camera , the youngster had another go immediately after and netted again . \" I think he ' s got it down now , \" said Lucy , who helps run a building firm with husband Matt , 34 . \" He is very confident but you can tell by the look on his face I think he was surprised too . \" The talented young centre midfielder has played

In an op - ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday , Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress . \" I wanted to keep this private , but recently the story broke to the world , \" Loeb wrote . \" It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved - - my ex is Sofia Vergara , who stars in the ABC series \" Modern Family \" - - but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life , religion and parenthood . \" Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later , at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate . After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term , they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm . \" When we create embryos for the purpose of life , should we not define them as life , rather than as property ? , \" he said . \" . . A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects . Shouldn ' t a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects ? \" Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42 - year - old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization . He filed it in August in Santa Monica , California , where they apparently lived while they dated . \" We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties ' consent . The form did not specify - - as California law requires - - what would happen if we separated , \" he said . \" I am asking to have it voided . \" Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past . Loeb has said he believes \" life begins at fertilization \" and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term . He said he doesn ' t want any money from the egg donor .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "39753996", "doc": "Brad McKay crouched to volley in Greg Tansey ' s deep free - kick early in the match . And Tansey converted a penalty after Massimo Donati had fouled Ross Draper . Accies were upset Ali Crawford was not awarded a second - half spot - kick for a challenge by goalkeeper Ryan Esson but netted late on through Danny Redmond . The gap between Caley Thistle and Motherwell also stands at four points , with Well behind Hamilton on goal difference after losing to Ross County . The first - half performance was exactly what Inverness manager Richie Foran has been searching for and came with their backs planted firmly against the wall . They were terrific . Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people , although nerves did seem to take effect after half - time . Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going . They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns , at least temporarily , to sides above . Tansey , who has agreed a pre - contract to join Aberdeen , was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory . It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender ' s finish was perfect . Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground . Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure . In truth , Inverness could have been out of sight by the break . Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey ' s drive . And , in the second period , Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over . Martin Canning ' s side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham . And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline . As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out , Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down . Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot , leaving Hamilton players in disbelief . It was a huge escape for the home side .

{"dataset": "CLIFF", "origin": "xsum", "id": "38328811", "doc": "United Nations officials rarely use the words \" genocide \" and \" ethnic cleansing , \" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world ' s youngest country . Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan , 340 , 000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda . That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200 , 000 people have fled Syria in 2016 . Every day , on average , another 2 , 500 South Sudanese become refugees , and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way , add to the evidence of killing , rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines . Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia . A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres . The first time he crossed was with his immediate family ; the second - a day later - was with his brother ' s wife and her five children who he had gone back to help . Six - year - old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road . I asked him what they had left behind . \" They are killing people , sleeping with wives , stealing . They are not shooting you , they are cutting you with a knife . Even small children can be beaten down , \" Mr Thomas told me . The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun . \" They don ' t want us , \" he said , and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei , just 80 km ( 50 miles ) from the border , had become a place he had to leave . \" These tribes of Dinka , they don ' t want Equatorians , they don ' t want … Nuer . They don ' t want them . \" Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "31111562", "doc": "The poster with the phrase # prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week . It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13 - year - old Joshua Martin , from Donaghadee , County Down . Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve . He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast . However , doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths . The news shocked Josh ' s family , but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world . It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church , where Josh ' s father is on the pastoral staff , and has since gone viral . The church ' s senior pastor , Gary Beattie , said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far . \" We were in total shock when he was diagnosed , and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh , \" Gary said . \" It certainly isn ' t a campaign as such , we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him . We had no idea that it would take off . \" We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation , and we ' ve been posting updates about Josh from his family . \" The update was shared 948 times and it ' s been seen by over 79 , 000 people . It ' s absolutely phenomenal . \" We thought there had been a mistake , but you can look at the views and where they ' ve come from , and there are people all over the world supporting him , which is great . \" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard ?

Of course Guardiola isn ' t alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe ; nor is it really down to St Andrews , though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs . Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter - final first leg against Porto . The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday . Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn ' t that the Barcelona team changed . Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them . What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews , where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola . There Messi was a distracted individual , sometimes sneering at Guardiola ' s insistence on organisation and pressing , according to Guillem Balague ' s account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola . But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics . The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing , sidling up to him after training , putting his arm round him to assure him of his support . Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi - final in his six years as a manager . Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics . Messi , the precocious star , suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola . And , as a result , he began to buy into Guardiola ' s idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki", "summ": "Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter - final .

Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits , such as lower levels of body fat , reduced heart disease risk factors , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes . But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain . They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins , who were all men aged 32 to 36 years . Focusing on twins , who have the same DNA , would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies . In each pair of twins , one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other , though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives . Dr Kujala said : ' On average , the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co - twins . ' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains , and specific regions . Exercise didn ' t seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole , Dr Kujala said . But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement , he added . Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar , which reduces the risk of diabetes , a finding which is already well - known .

Angry parents took to the school ' s Facebook page to complain about the new measures . But Hanson Academy claims it \" communicated clearly \" its expectations for this school year . Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons , including if they wear hoop earrings , two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers . Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers , jackets or coats indoors , and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed . Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday . She said in an earlier statement : \" We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted . \" As forewarned , some students were sent home for this reason . \" They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn . \" The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for \" adult life \" . She said : \" This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct , on behaviour , on attitudes and respect . \" Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other . \" It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school . \" Caren Oxlaide ' s son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes . She said : \" It states black shoes , lace - up , no trainers and flat - soled . That ' s exactly what his are , pure leather . \" She said buying new shoes was not an easy option . \" I can ' t really afford them , not on income support . But I ' ve got to somehow do it because my son ' s education is important . \" Diane Hickey ' s daughter Cassidy , 13 , was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps . \" I ' m not buying her a new pair of shoes . I ' m a single parent . I can ' t afford a new pair of shoes , \" she said . Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home .

There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served , a clink of cutlery on crockery , the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups . Somewhere outside , the clouds part and light floods the lounge . I reach for another scone , ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream , and marvel that , in this context , 70 years seems an eternity . Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey ' s only five - star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere . Seventy years on : St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands ( 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945 ) , this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters . Invading officers would have stalked its corridors . By April 1945 , they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin , and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D - Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation . That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto . The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival ( 3 April – 11 May ) is a five - week hurrah of history , parades , concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey , Alderney , Jersey , Herm and Sark . This is no small feat . Fiercely individual , the islands have never before combined to stage a big event . But here they have common cause . Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey ' s capital St Helier into swirls of people and music . It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey ' s harrowing half - decade . The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy , sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast ; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north . Intrigued , I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower , on the south - west shore . It is an oddly unnerving experience , the pillar - box slots in the bastion ' s sides eyeing me quietly", "summ": "The Channel Islands are celebrating 70 years since the end of World War II .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "36467415", "doc": "My sources include collectors all over the world , dealers , auctions , flea markets , and just about any place I can think of . The accumulation , as I like to call it , includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry . Within this rapidly growing accumulation , I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach . My recent exhibition , titled \" Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell \" , features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry . I exhibited 5 , 000 labels from my collection of 25 , 000 . AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur . It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat ( also known as Cambay ) in Gujarat state , and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two . The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries . Ambarnath , written in Hindi on this label , was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state . Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long . This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands . This label promoted the Swadeshi ( self - reliance ) movement during the partition of India ' s Bengal region in 1905 . A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods . Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands . Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India ' s struggle for freedom . Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement . It ' s believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule .

The study , commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools , looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools . Many pupils reported that they took an internet - connected device to bed to continue social media conversations . The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home . Tablets are now being used , at least to some extent , in 68 % of primary and 69 % of secondary schools , according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family , Kids and Youth research group . But researchers found examples of much more intensive use . In 9 % of schools , there was an individual tablet device for every pupil . The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools . The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present , 45 % reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them . Between 2014 and 2016 , the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430 , 000 to almost 900 , 000 . But Dr Clarke , formerly of the University of Cambridge ' s education department , says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results . Researchers can not isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment . But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact . And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families . Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools . \" The type of device might change , but it ' s not going to go away . It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology , \" she said . A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson , published on Monday , suggested that touch - screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read . It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch - screen computers rather than printed books . The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people .

Yorkshire ' s run - chase was undermined by a three - wicket burst in nine balls from Stuart Meaker , whose victims included Jonny Bairstow and Gary Ballance . Tim Bresnan made 68 but was the last to go as they were all out for 236 . Having lost to Durham in the T20 Blast semi - finals last weekend , Yorkshire were hoping to atone by reaching Lord ' s for the first time since 2002 . They made the ideal start as Dominic Sibley and Kumar Sangakkara went inside the first three overs , the Sri Lankan making only four before needlessly giving a catch to cover . But they were left to rue Matthew Waite dropping Davies , then on 43 , off his own bowling just after having Rory Burns caught on the boundary . Davies went on to hit a six and 10 fours before finally falling to Waite , who took 3 - 48 and also dropped a more difficult return chance offered by Foakes . After losing Adam Lyth early , Yorkshire were well - placed on 75 - 2 , but fast bowler Meaker ( 3 - 61 ) turned the game on its head by ripping out Bairstow ( 13 ) , who lobbed tamely to mid - wicket , Ballance ( 32 ) and Jack Leaning . Bresnan and Waite ( 38 ) did their best to repair the damage , but 27 off the final three overs was too much and Bresnan holed out at long - off with seven balls remaining . Surrey skipper Gareth Batty told BBC Radio London : \" Everyone is stepping up to the plate when the team requires , everybody ' s pulling together . \" Davies and Foakes were quite magnificent , that partnership blew the game wide open . \" The position we got ourselves to , I thought we should maybe have been 265 or 270 . \" But we got wickets at the right times and it was always going to be an uphill battle for them once it got down to those final overs . \" Yorkshire captain Alex Lees : \" We are all gutted . We have played some great white - ball cricket this season , but when it has mattered we haven ' t been good enough . \" The bowlers were exceptional and we thought it was a reachable target .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "38550016", "doc": "Those were the days , by the way , when phones were for making calls but all that was about to change . “ Have you got your hands on this new Apple phone for a piece to camera ? ” shouted a producer in London . “ If not , why not ? ” This appeared to be an impossible demand . Steve Jobs had just unveiled the iPhone before an adoring crowd but it was not available for grubby hacks to manhandle . Then I remembered that we had been offered - and turned down for lack of time - an interview with Apple ’ s marketing chief Phil Schiller . I turned around and headed back to the Moscone Centre . Having located Mr Schiller I asked whether before our interview I might just have a look at the iPhone . He graciously handed his over - and rather than trying to ring Jony I ve or order 5 , 000 lattes as Steve Jobs had on stage , I brandished it at the camera for my Ten O ’ Clock News piece . The following weekend a Sunday newspaper columnist described me as having clutched the phone as if it were “ a fragment of the true cross ” , and some viewers complained that the BBC had given undue prominence to a product launch . I appeared on the Newswatch programme to defend our reporting and said that some products did merit coverage because they promised a step change in the way we lived - and I mused on whether the Model T Ford would have been a story if we ’ d had a TV news bulletin back then . Afterwards , I rather regretted saying that - who knew whether the iPhone would really prove as revolutionary as the arrival of mass car ownership ? But today that comparison does not look so outlandish . The smartphone has been the key transformative technology of the last decade , putting powerful computers in the hands of more than two billion people and disrupting all sorts of industries . One example is in the photograph at the top of this article . It ’ s not very good - but then again it was taken by me on a digital SLR camera .

It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries . Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote . A record number of 46 . 8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election , 500 , 000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46 . 4 million figure for the EU referendum . Of these , 68 . 7 % actually voted on the day , the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997 . There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline . In total , 2 . 9 million applications were received over the six - week period . Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10 % , including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury , Cambridge , Bristol West and Leeds Central . However , concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year ' s EU referendum - continue to persist . At the moment , there is no direct link between electoral registers , which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain , and the online registration service now used by a majority of people . The two systems use different databases and can not communicate directly with each other . Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline , about 4 . 9 million applications to vote were submitted , the majority of them done online . But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1 . 4 million , suggesting \" a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates \" . With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered , the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30 % and 70 % in different areas . The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites , including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia , New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland . Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May ' s local council elections , the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed . \" The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service", "summ": "more than one million people have applied

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights . The EU objects to Hungary ' s tight controls on asylum seekers and non - governmental organisations ( NGOs ) , as well as a higher education law . Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University , founded by philanthropist George Soros . Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months . Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues , Mr Szijjarto answered : \" No . Why should we ? \" These laws belong to national competence , so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues . \" The minister added that \" my Polish colleague \" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary . EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously . Hungary ' s right - wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws , two of which have already been passed , the BBC ' s Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports . Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers , raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law . Hungary ' s Higher Education Law , signed in April , could force the closure of the Budapest - based CEU , which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines .

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "36008563", "doc": "Jamie Vardy ' s crisp finish from a lightning break gave Leicester the lead on 18 minutes - but he was then sent off after getting a second yellow card for diving when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna early in the second half . Referee Jonathan Moss made himself even more unpopular when he awarded West Ham a penalty with six minutes left . There had been pushing and pulling in both penalty areas but he decided to punish Wes Morgan for pulling back Winston Reid at a corner . Analysis : MOTD2 pundits on referee ' s ' mind - boggling inconsistencies ' Substitute Andy Carroll slotted home to end Leicester ' s run of 574 minutes without conceding a league goal and Aaron Cresswell looked to have opened the door to the Foxes ' title rivals Spurs with a stunning left - footed finish two minutes later . As the game went into injury time , Moss produced another controversial decision when he pointed to the spot once more after Carroll made the merest contact with Jeff Schlupp . West Ham clearly felt Moss had evened things up after earlier decisions in their favour , but Ulloa was not concerned as he took the chance to secure what might yet be a vital point - although Leicester will be without Vardy for next weekend ' s home game with Swansea . Relive the action from the King Power Stadium Leicester ' s fans celebrated at the end before turning their anger on referee Moss - although it was his very questionable decision that allowed them to earn that point at the end . Psychologically , this point could be vital because a loss might just have produced a few doubts and given Spurs just a little more wiggle room going into their game at Stoke on Monday . It means Leicester ' s last Premier League defeat is still that last - minute loss at Arsenal on Valentine ' s Day and their spirits will be lifted by the manner in which they earned a point when it seemed certain they would end up empty - handed . Referee Moss was surrounded by players of both sides and escorted from the field by stewards to jeering from the home fans at the final whistle . Moss ' s eventful second half began after 56 minutes when he penalised Vardy for simulation as he tumbled theatrically under a challenge from Ogbonna . Having already given Vardy a yellow card , he felt obliged to give a second . Vardy made the most of the contact and ran the risk of punishment .

The NAC , which sanctioned the bout , told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday . NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10 oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August . Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing . Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating : \" I ' ll be wearing 8 oz Grant gloves . \" But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage . Instead , his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed . At the time , NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8 oz gloves at 154lbs before . Rules state that 10 oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8 oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified . \" Even if they are both in agreement , our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters , \" said Bennett . \" To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine . \" During his UFC career , McGregor has used 4 oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather ' s Instagram post last week , stating : \" I am coming sprinting at you with bricks . Brittle hands . \" The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision . McGregor , 29 , will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history . The UFC lightweight champion ' s move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather , 40 , has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin . But Bennett says he studied a \" litany of information \" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were \" several reasons to approve the fight \" . Bennett said that McGregor ' s UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion . \" I spoke to Virgil Hunter , who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward ,

But the move was blocked by the Foreign Office as its rules stated British soldiers could not receive a foreign medal if the act happened more than five years ago .

Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie . The Dandies ' deadline - day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales ' Euro 2016 finals squad . However , the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary . While they brought in two replacements , the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run .

The Edinburgh club have replaced the Swede with Abiola Dauda , a Nigerian striker on loan from Vitesse who has an even more impressive scoring record .

Scroll down for video The ' special relationship ' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan The document – prepared by the Congressional Research Service , an in - house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators – states that while Britain and the US are likely to ‘ remain key economic partners ’ , a ‘ reassessment of the special relationship may be in order … because its geopolitical setting has been changing ’ . The memo , edited by Derek E Mix , the CRS ’ s chief European affairs analyst , says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the ‘ influence and centrality of the relationship ’ .

It reads : ‘ A significant degree of the UK ’ s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy , further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation . ’ Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011 .

It was first coined in a 1944 speech by Winston Churchill , when he said it was his ‘ deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship … another destructive war will come to pass ’ .

By the late 2000s , this area had fallen to about 275 sq km . The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) Fall Meeting , the world ' s largest annual gathering of Earth scientists . It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations , but predominantly Switzerland , Austria , Slovenia , Germany , France , and Italy . The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent , from the University of Savoie , and colleagues . It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins , Belledonne , Vanoise , Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs , as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north . The team drew upon map archives , past satellite imagery and aerial photographs . Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct . \" We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier , \" explained Ms Gardent . \" Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there . Also , deep shadows can hide the glacier margins . \" The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory . It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km . By 1985 - 86 , in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s / early 80s , glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km , the new survey shows . Since then , the withdrawal has accelerated , with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s . This represents an average loss of some 26 % over the last 40 years . The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps , however . The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors . In the Belledonne Massif , for example , glaciers have almost completely disappeared ; and in the Ecrins Massif , glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif . \" The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps , \" Ms Gardent emphasised . \" We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south , but

{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "32435850", "doc": "Yet in this election , it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties . Philip Hammond , himself a former defence secretary , has been reported as saying recently that \" there are no votes in defence \" . He does not recognise the quote , but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns , way behind the economy , the NHS and immigration . UK military interventions in Iraq , Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject . James de Waal , a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House , says in this campaign , politicians have been \" on the defensive on defence \" . This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK ’ s defence forces at home and abroad . Policy guide : Where the parties stand To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos . Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face . So to help , here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out . Most analysts , and politicians , agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable , whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so - called failed states , the threat from Islamic extremism , or a more belligerent Russia . Yet at the same time , most European nations , including the UK , have been making significant cuts to their armed forces . The size of the UK ' s regular Army is being reduced from 102 , 000 to 82 , 000 . You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare . The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships , while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front - line fast jet squadrons . There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so - called capability gaps . The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft . It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters .

People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce . It means an extra £ 2 , 100 a year – £ 17 , 800 rather than £ 15 , 700 – to anyone who has kept their marriage intact , or who has never married , according to the survey for the Prudential . It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles . The debt of a divorced retiree averages £ 22 , 100 , Prudential ’ s report said , while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers . Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that £ 9 , 500 – the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life . By comparison , only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line , yesterday ’ s report said . The impact of divorce on a former spouse ’ s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working . The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up . Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school , worse in their careers after they leave school , to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime , and to suffer worse health . The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult , studies suggests The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands , wives and children suffer during a divorce – usually including loss of income , the price of running two homes instead of one , legal costs , and the long - term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse – does not fade away even as old age approaches . Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children , a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through ‘ pension - splitting ’ arrangements .

The original Jolly Fisherman poster was commissioned by the Great Northern Railway to encourage visitors to take the train on their seaside breaks to Skegness . The poster featured the slogan \" Skegness is so bracing \" . It was commissioned in 1908 for 12 guineas and has became synonymous with the Lincolnshire resort .

Brecon and Radnorshire Conservative MP Chris Davies condemned the closure , saying there had been a barracks in Brecon since 1805 , home to troops who fought the Zulus at Rorke ' s Drift . \" This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way , \" he said . \" The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well - loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town . \" Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history , with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century . \" This decision shows a blatant lack of respect for that history . \" Mr Davies said he was launching a petition against the decision , saying the Brecon area had some of the highest unemployment levels in Wales . He also hoped the closure would not damage the town ' s \" thriving \" military tourism industry . Brecon barracks has about 85 civilian staff and 90 military but it is not thought jobs are at risk . Mr Davies said he understood the nearby Sennybridge training ground and infantry school at Dering Lines would not be affected . Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon told the Commons on Monday the reorganisation in Wales would see a specialist light infantry centre created at St Athan , Vale of Glamorgan .

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station ' s top job in an interview on Radio 4 ' s Feedback programme . Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years . He said : ' If you look back at the Third Programme ( the original name for Radio 3 ) , they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything . ' They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them . ' The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so , anyway . ' We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works . ' It ' s not lowering the standard , it ' s not making the content simple . It ' s about how we present it . ' Mr Davey , who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England , added : ' I believe there are different ways to draw people into music . ' There ' s the Classic FM way , and they ' re very good at that . ' We ' ll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers , and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout . ' The station has been accused of ' dumbing down ' in the past , especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more ' accessible ' to a broader audience . Last year Mr Davey ' s predecessor Roger Wright ( above ) dismissed as ' complete nonsense ' claims that the station was dumbing down With just two million listeners , Radio 3 is the least listened - to of the BBC ' s main stations . Last year Mr Davey ' s predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as ' complete nonsense ' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations . He said : ' I just don ' t recognise it at all . Apparently we do phone - ins ? We don ' t . ' We haven ' t had a request show for a long , long time . You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that ' s not exactly a phone - in . So it ' s complete nonsense .

The three - year Sounds of the City study , was led by Professor Jane Stuart - Smith , director of the university ' s laboratory of phonetics . \" We were quite surprised by what we found , \" she said . \" The assumption is that traditional dialects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether , but what we have learned , particularly with the Glasgow accent , is that Scots accents are actually flourishing . \" Interestingly , what is not happening in Scotland is the dilution of accents to a more homogenised anglicised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England , and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive . \" As part of its study , the Glasgow team built up a digitised body of recorded speech sounds . The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes . One set are common accent changes , which have spread right across the UK , such as the \" f \" and \" l \" examples . The team said this change was being spread partly by dialect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London . The project also uncovered a second set of finer changes local to Scotland . These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat , goat and coat , or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin , top and cat . The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time , or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo - English accents . Their evidence suggested , however , that these features and others were all changing , the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo - English changes , and that they had been happening for 100 years or more . The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War . The study focused on six audio recordings , made in 1916 and held by the British Library , of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps . From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago , and perhaps even earlier , Scottish accents were already changing . The research and findings of the project will be made available to students and other researchers", "summ": "accents in the uk are being eroded , according to a new study of the city\\ 's accent in the uk .", "model_name": "PtGen", "cut": "test", "error_type": ["correct"], "annotated_span": [], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [5], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]}, {"V": [6], "NP": [7]}, {"V": [20], "NP": [19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]}, {"V": [47], "NP": [48]}, {"V": [57], "NP": [55]}, {"V": [59, 64], "NP": [60, 62, 63, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69]}, {"V": [68], "NP": [65, 66, 67, 69]}, {"V": [82], "NP": [71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]}, {"V": [102], "NP": [101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]}, {"V": [108], "NP": [106, 107]}, {"V": [112], "NP": [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 111]}, {"V": [117], "NP": [115, 116, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133]}, {"V": [127], "NP": [119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124]}, {"V": [131, 133], "NP": [129]}, {"V": [139, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145], "NP": [136, 137]}, {"V": [147], "NP": [136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]}, {"V": [152, 153], "NP": [149, 150]}, {"V": [160, 161], "NP": [158, 162, 163]}, {"V": [156, 164], "NP": [158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [173], "NP": [174]}, {"V": [181], "NP": [176, 177, 178, 179, 182, 183]}, {"V": [191], "NP": [186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 192, 193]}, {"V": [196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 205], "NP": [202, 203, 204, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213]}, {"V": [211], "NP": [212, 213]}, {"V": [213], "NP": [211, 212]}, {"V": [217], "NP": [215, 216, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]}, {"V": [220], "NP": [218, 219, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230]}, {"V": [226], "NP": [221, 222, 223, 224, 227, 228, 229, 230]}, {"V": [234], "NP": [232, 233, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]}, {"V": [241], "NP": [235, 236, 237, 239, 242, 243, 244, 245]}, {"V": [261], "NP": [259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281]}, {"V": [266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281], "NP": [262, 263]}, {"V": [279], "NP": [277, 278, 280, 281]}, {"V": [286], "NP": [283, 284, 285, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295]}, {"V": [298], "NP": [297, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326]}, {"V": [299, 302], "NP": [300, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308, 309, 310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326]}, {"V": [299, 314], "NP": [315, 316, 317, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326]}, {"V": [318], "NP": [315, 316, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326]}, {"V": [330], "NP": [328, 329, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338, 339, 340, 341, 342, 343, 344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354]}, {"V": [335], "NP": [331, 332, 336, 337, 338]}, {"V": [344, 345, 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354], "NP": [331, 332]}, {"V": [358], "NP": [356, 357, 360, 362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396]}, {"V": [369], "NP": [363, 364, 365, 366]}, {"V": [373], "NP": [371, 372, 374, 375, 376, 377]}, {"V": [378, 379], "NP": [371, 372, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384]}, {"V": [391], "NP": [388, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396]}, {"V": [401], "NP": [398, 399, 400, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418]}, {"V": [409], "NP": [410, 411, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418]}, {"V": [411], "NP": [402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408, 412, 413, 414, 415, 416, 417, 418]}, {"V": [422], "NP": [420, 421, 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446]}, {"V": [428], "NP": [424, 425, 426, 429, 430]}, {"V": [432], "NP": [424, 425, 426, 433, 434, 435, 436]}, {"V": [448, 449, 450, 452], "NP": [451, 453, 454, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]}, {"V": [455], "NP": [453, 456, 457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471]}, {"V": [471], "NP": [457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 470]}, {"V": [480, 482], "NP": [483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488]}]}

The Russian state \" is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot \" and had \" reasons aplenty \" for wishing him \" not only harm , but death \" , he said . UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko , 43 , in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing . Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium - 210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi . He died in hospital nearly three weeks later . The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation , Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks . He said : \" The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko ' s murder . \" However , he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder . Defecting to the UK in 2000 , after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption , could have been seen as \" akin to treachery \" , he said . He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko ' s \" many personal attacks on Putin \" . Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known , and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run - up to his death . He said : \" The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage . They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise . \" We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long - term effects will be visited upon Londoners . \" Mr Horwell said the suspects left a \" trail of polonium \" behind and they had \" no credible answer \" to the scientific evidence against them .

The battle to replace long - standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days ' time . \" 4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad - Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced , \" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday . Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser , who was also on the Ad - Hoc Electoral Committee , stepped aside for this reason . \" Prior to the final review process , Domenico Scala ( as a dual Swiss / Italian national ) and Claudio Sulser ( as a Swiss national ) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality , \" Fifa wrote at the time . However Andreas Bantel , a spokesman for Scala , says \" the fact that a member of the ad - hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest . \" There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa , \" he told BBC Sport . \" For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President . Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base . \" For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President . Hence , there is no potential conflict of interest at all . \" It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport . In his letter to Scala , he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election . \" Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution , the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa , \" Bility wrote . \" If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah -", "summ": "a

The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to ' feel ' the sensation as intensely as possible . Usually practiced in pairs , there is a ' strokee ' and a ' stroker ' .

There are currently over 10 , 000 practitioners worldwide and 2 , 000 in the UK alone . There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe . OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer , if those attending desire a more private setting .

Ahead of Sunday ' s FA Cup semi - final against Aston Villa at Wembley , Rodgers indicated it could take two decades for Sheik Mansour ’ s club to reach the status of either Liverpool or Manchester United . City have been heavily linked with a £ 50million move for Sterling , who has two years left on his contract and is stalling on a new deal . The champions have also monitored vice - captain Jordan Henderson , who only has a season left on his Anfield contract . Brendan Rodgers says that a move to Manchester City would not be step up for Raheem Sterling . Rodgers talks to Sterling during Friday ' s training session ahead of FA Cup semi - final against Aston Villa . However , Rodgers was emphatic that moving to City would not represent a step up . ‘ If you say that City is a bigger club than Liverpool , you ’ re wrong , ’ he said . ‘ I ’ ve got big respect for what City are doing — they ’ re trying to build it the right way . But at this moment you can ’ t compare the size of the two clubs . ‘ You ’ ve got Liverpool and United , the two biggest clubs in this country and the rest of them are fighting to be there over the next 20 years . I wouldn ’ t say we were a development ground for going to “ bigger ” clubs . City have tried to sign players from Arsenal and Liverpool hoping to weaken their rivals . They have bought Gael Clichy , Emmanuel Adebayor , Bacary Sagna and Kolo Toure from Arsenal but failed to lure Fernando Torres when he was at Anfield . . Sterling is wanted by Manchester City this summer for £ 50million as he stalls over new contract . Sterling has been one of Liverpool ' s leading lights and was nominated for PFA Young Player of the Year . This summer , Liverpool will also try to sign James Milner from City . Rodgers hopes victory over Villa will strengthen his case and increase the chances of keeping players . ‘ Our vision is to win trophies , ’ he said . ‘ The first objective was to get into the Champions League again . We arrived there this year and could focus on winning a trophy . We just have to concentrate on performance levels , get to the final and we ’ ll take it from there .", "summ": "Brendan Rodgers has written off Manchester City 's chances of signing Raheem Sterling this summer .

It said the council tax had built - in problems \" from day one \" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers . The commission , set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla , will report back later this year . Prof Kenneth Gibb , from the University of Glasgow , was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world . He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a \" good tax \" because it was stable , difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets . But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection . Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income . Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax , used by many countries , was generally perceived as fairer . But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated . There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities . He said : \" It is clear there is no magic bullet . \" Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform . \" So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies , change and reform is a major undertaking . \" The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn . A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system \" as a whole to be unfair \" . He added : \" That is why , along with our local government partners , we have established the cross - party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives . \" The Scottish government

The evacuation affected three streets , with wider safety advice issued to residents within 500 m of the device . There was also an exclusion zone at sea of about half a mile , and small boat owners were told not to sail during the operation . Caledonian MacBrayne reported some disruption to ferry services , affecting sailings from Gourock and Rothesay . Ch Insp Elliot Brown , the local area commander for Inverclyde , stressed that the evacuation had been a precautionary measure , and that there was no immediate danger to the community of Gourock .

The Art Fund , which led the campaign , will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum , before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum .

The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc ' s pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009 .

It said individual electoral registers run by councils should be better joined up to help identify duplicate entries . Labour warned against making it harder for young people to register to vote . A record number of 46 . 8 million people were registered to vote in the 8 June election , 500 , 000 higher than in 2015 and also more than the 46 . 4 million figure for the EU referendum . Of these , 68 . 7 % actually voted on the day , the highest turnout figure for a general election since 1997 . There was a surge in applications to register to the vote in the days after Theresa May called the snap poll on 18 April and also in the days leading up to the 22 May deadline . In total , 2 . 9 million applications were received over the six - week period . Several constituencies found that the size of their electorate rose by more than 10 % , including seats with large student populations such as Canterbury , Cambridge , Bristol West and Leeds Central . However , concerns over the number of duplicate applications - a problem which initially surfaced after last year ' s EU referendum - continue to persist . At the moment , there is no direct link between electoral registers , which are held and managed by electoral registration officials around Britain , and the online registration service now used by a majority of people . The two systems use different databases and can not communicate directly with each other . Between 1 December 2016 and the 22 May deadline , about 4 . 9 million applications to vote were submitted , the majority of them done online . But the net increase in the number of entries on the electoral register during that period was only 1 . 4 million , suggesting \" a significant proportion of applications are likely to have been duplicates \" . With no way of people checking online whether they are already registered , the proportion of duplicate applications is estimated to have ranged between 30 % and 70 % in different areas . The watchdog said this had caused significant administration and financial burdens for electoral officials and should be addressed by clearer information on registration sites , including potentially a verification function which it said was used in Australia , New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland . Despite efforts to flag up to people that they did not need to register if they had been sent a poll card or had voted in May ' s local council elections , the watchdog said it appeared to have made little difference and urgent action was now needed . \" The relative ease of submitting an application to register to vote using the online service", "summ": "a record number of people have been

The latests picture , captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava , reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption . Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano , which is also known as the Fire volcano , to prepare for a possible evacuation . Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano ( above ) in Mexico The 12 , 400 feet ( 3 , 800 metre ) high volcano , which first erupted in 1576 , is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico . Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1 . 8 miles ( three kilometres ) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture . He said : ' I waited for eight hours , knowing something was going to happen . When the lightning arrived it was magical . An unforgettable experience . ' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other . Just like in a thunder cloud , this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning . This sequence of images captured by photographer Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night - time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming , according to a recent study . Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur - rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth . Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate . However , a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature . This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0 . 05 ° C to 0 . 12 ° C over the past 15 years . Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks . They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass .", "summ": "hernando rivera cervantes reveals the raw power of a volcanic

In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven ' t got a suitable area to spend a penny . Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet ? \" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres , cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory . Lorna Fillingham , mother of six - year - old Emily - May , is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory \" It ' s like playing Russian roulette , \" Lorna says . \" Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren ' t suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful . \" My daughter is only six so she doesn ' t have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through , but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty . \" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people . There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they ? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet the needs of people who use them . Mike LeSurf , Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says : \" There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door , people ' s needs are not being met . \" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away . \" Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn ' t a bench and hoist in the toilet , \" she says . \"", "summ": "change is a problem for many disabled people .", "model_name": "BERTS2S", "cut": "val", "error_type":

Southampton ' s Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break . Belgium were very disappointing , with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal . Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool ' s Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level . Before the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality , and even coach Antonio Conte said : \" It isn ' t a good time for our football . \" The soon - to - be - Chelsea boss added : \" It ' s important the squad has a good spirit . I work a lot at this . \" On the evidence of this game , that is not the only thing he has worked at . Italy ' s triumph was a result of superior organisation and discipline against 11 Belgian individuals who appear to possess , on paper at least , the greater talent . Both sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden , who drew 1 - 1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday . With 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage , Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their likeliest challengers . Italy have won this competition once , in 1968 , and finished runners - up twice - most recently in 2012 , when they were demolished 4 - 0 by Spain in the final . While the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying , winning seven of their 10 matches , they compare unfavourably with the side of four years ago , lacking the calm , creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli . What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea - bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus - centric defence . Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium , leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter - attacking brilliance - which Bonucci ' s 50 - yard , defence - splitting pass and Giaccherini ' s cool finish provided .

A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight , and it seems they have more space than any passengers . A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe , giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut - eye during long - haul flights . Scroll down for video First class accommodation ! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents , their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious , private and with maximum personal comfort . Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit ( PSU ) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an in - flight entertainment and air conditioning system . In order to maximise the sense of space , innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented . The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week , which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing . The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests for Airbus A330 / A340 since the ' 90s and is the market leader for this area . Each section boasts a personal service unit ( PSU ) offering crew with individual in - flight entertainment systems and air conditioning They aimed to start from a clean slate in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas , and conducted extensive market research to achieve this . ' The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight , but also to enhance the user experience , ' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift . ' In every step of the process users were involved . ' The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests . ' The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to 30 flight attendants from four different continents Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners . Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas , the Boeing Crew Rest Departments ( CRCs ) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane , or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers .",

The memo for members of Congress states damningly that ‘ the UK may not be viewed as centrally relevant to the United States in all of the issues and relations considered a priority on the US agenda ’ . Dated April 2015 and drawn up to brief the Senate and House of Representatives on the impact of Britain ’ s General Election , the memo also warns that the UK faces turmoil if there is a hung parliament . Scroll down for video The ' special relationship ' between Britain and the US was strong under Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan The document – prepared by the Congressional Research Service , an in - house intelligence body that gives confidential analysis to legislators – states that while Britain and the US are likely to ‘ remain key economic partners ’ , a ‘ reassessment of the special relationship may be in order … because its geopolitical setting has been changing ’ . The memo , edited by Derek E Mix , the CRS ’ s chief European affairs analyst , says that the development of organisations such as the G20 group of major economies has led to a decline in the ‘ influence and centrality of the relationship ’ . It also states that the UK ’ s continued importance to the US will hinge on the future success of the economy – and Chancellor George Osborne ’ s implementation of spending cuts . It reads : ‘ A significant degree of the UK ’ s international influence flows from the success and dynamism of the British economy , further raising the stakes on whether the UK can sustain stronger economic growth while continuing to pursue ambitious fiscal consolidation . ’ Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama serve food during a Downing Street barbecue in May 2011 . When Cameron visited the White House in January , he insisted the President had said the special relationship was ‘ stronger than it has ever been ’ Winston Churchill first coined the phrase ' special relationship ' in a speech in 1944 The ‘ special relationship ’ has been deployed by generations of politicians – most notably Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher – to describe the close political , diplomatic , cultural , economic , military and historical relations between the two countries . It was first coined in a 1944 speech by Winston Churchill , when he said it was his ‘ deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship … another destructive war will come to pass ’ .

What exactly is \" service of process \" ? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . Sounds simple , right ? In theory it is . In practice , it turns out people don ' t like being sued . It also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . Just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . Once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . Unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go \" off the grid \" . Although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . In - person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . So , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant ' s right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff ' s access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . As reliable as the U . S . mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . Not because the postmen can ' t be trusted ; they can . Neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . Instead , it ' s defendants - - no wait , all of humanity - - that can ' t be trusted . Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn ' t get it . Defendants are no different . One form of alternate service is \" nail and mail \" service . This means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant ' s front door . The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , doesn ' t mean he ' ll be back there anytime soon . Another , even odder form of \" service \" is service by publication . This is an almost laughable legal fiction . If you can ' t find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication .

It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi . The law seeks to end Italy ' s post - war era of revolving governments , political horse - trading and unstable coalitions . The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61 . The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40 % of the national vote . If no party reaches that threshold , there is a second - round run - off between the two parties with the most votes . The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year . After the vote , Mr Renzi said : \" Commitment achieved , promise respected . Italy needs people who don ' t always say no . \" Critics have accused the 40 - year - old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power . They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties , gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates , and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives . Opposition parties boycotted Monday ' s vote . Renato Brunetta , parliamentary head of centre - right opposition party Forza Italia , said afterwards that it was \" a very ugly day for our country ' s democracy \" .

The charity , Fresh Start Housing , finds clients from London homeless charities . Neither the charity nor the company act illegally , but a homeless group says the relationship is \" a new low \" . Investing Solutions said \" the bulk \" of their rents get passed to private landlords , while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords . The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person , rather than the property . Therefore , the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property ' s landlord . Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building , a storage unit in south London . Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel , who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010 . The documents say the charity would help \" the needs of current and ex - offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty , sickness and distress \" . Operating across seven London boroughs , Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK , making the venture hugely profitable . In one property we visited , Investing Solutions was claiming £ 2 , 114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants . The owner of the house was getting £ 1 , 150 per month , giving the agency an annual gross profit of £ 11 , 568 on the one property . The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35 , saying that is because this is the group facing \" the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation \" . But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation . In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates , that means they can charge up to £ 260 per week for each private room . One of the tenants , Nigel McCann , was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing . They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water , rats and damp . He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable . Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014 . \" It ' s all about the money", "summ": "more than # 1 m has been spent on private

A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6 , 000 metres ( 3 . 7 miles ) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1 , 000 metres . But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big , it posed a danger to passing aircraft . The kite , dubbed ' centipede with a dragon ' s head ' , was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south - western China , according to People ' s Daily Online . Scroll down for video Flying high : Half of the 6 , 000 - metre - long dragon - themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday Skilful : The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to manoeuvre However , Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon - themed kite - which is made from 2 , 000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown , and the team were forced to fly only half of it . The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part , with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event . Each of the 2 , 000 pieces bears the Chinese characters ' China Dream ' and it takes eight hours to get the full - length kite airborne . Wang Dongming , one of the three kite flyers , said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the kite . Mr Wang said : ' Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind . ' In order to secure the pieces on the kite , craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind . Colourful : Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four - day - long festival Although the kite did not fly full - length , organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world .

In some cases it can leave them feeling isolated and unable to enjoy the simplest of everyday activities that we take for granted just because they haven ' t got a suitable area to spend a penny . Ordinary accessible toilets may be the answer for many independent wheelchair users - but what about those who need two carers to help them or need a hoist to help them transfer on to a bench to change rather than a toilet ? \" Recommendations are in place to support installing Changing Places toilets with enhanced facilities when designing larger buildings such as shopping centres , cinemas and leisure facilities - but campaigners are calling for these to be made compulsory . Lorna Fillingham , mother of six - year - old Emily - May , is concerned about the lack of truly accessible toilet facilities in town centres and has started a petition to campaign for changes in building regulations to make Changing Places guidelines compulsory \" It ' s like playing Russian roulette , \" Lorna says . \" Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren ' t suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful . \" My daughter is only six so she doesn ' t have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through , but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty . \" Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people . There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they ? They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet the needs of people who use them .

accessible toilet door , people ' s needs are not being met . \" Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son

In his response to Mr Hedges , Mr Hammond said : \" It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received , in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc . \" This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes . \" Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business . \" Mr Hedges welcomed the minister ' s assurances . He added : \" Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA , I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc . \" I am pleased the minister is committed to redeployment rather than redundancies and I am sure this response will give comfort to many concerned DVLA employees . \"", "summ": "the chancellor\\ 's response to the government\\ 's tax disc tax disc will be ` ` managed\\'\\'by the government , a minister has said .", "model_name": "PtGen", "cut": "val", "error_type": ["correct"], "annotated_span": [], "claim_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [12, 16], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 18]}, {"V": [23], "NP": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21]}], "doc_frames_word_ids": [{"V": [2], "NP": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]}, {"V": [5, 6], "NP": [3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]}, {"V": [16], "NP": [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18]}, {"V": [22], "NP": [20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]}, {"V": [39], "NP": [37, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]}, {"V": [45], "NP": [40, 41, 42, 43]}, {"V": [45, 47], "NP": [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48, 50, 51, 52]}, {"V": [75], "NP": [54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85]}, {"V": [89], "NP": [87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]}, {"V": [94, 96], "NP": [91, 92, 93, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]}, {"V": [108, 109], "NP": [105, 106, 107, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]}, {"V": [112, 115, 116, 117, 118], "NP": [110, 113, 114]}, {"V": [123, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135], "NP": [120, 121, 124, 125, 126]}, {"V": [127], "NP": [120, 121, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135]}, {"V": [146], "NP": [137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [150], "NP": [151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [160], "NP": [153, 154, 155, 156, 157]}, {"V": [160, 161], "NP": [153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [163, 164], "NP": [165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]}, {"V": [173], "NP": [172]}, {"V": [187, 188], "NP": [186, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]}, {"V": [197], "NP": [198, 199, 200]}, {"V": [209], "NP": [206, 208, 210, 211, 212]}, {"V": [213, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224], "NP": [203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212]}, {"V": [217], "NP": [218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224]}, {"V": [229], "NP": [227, 228, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234]}, {"V": [237], "NP": [236, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]}, {"V": [241], "NP": [242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 256]}, {"V": [245, 246], "NP": [243, 244, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254]}, {"V": [257, 258], "NP": [240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 256, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]}, {"V": [263, 264, 265, 266, 267], "NP": []}, {"V": [269, 270], "NP": []}, {"V": [272], "NP": [256, 273, 274, 275]}, {"V": [279], "NP": [278, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]}, {"V": [283], "NP": [281, 282, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]}, {"V": [284], "NP": [281, 282, 285, 286, 287, 288, 289]}, {"V": [286], "NP": [281, 282]}, {"V": [292], "NP": [291, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303]}, {"V": [296, 297], "NP": [294, 295, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303]}]}
{"dataset": "xsumfaith", "origin": "xsum", "id": "36307661", "doc": "Management body NHS Employers has given the plan the green light after advisers said there were a range of extra tasks they could do with more training . A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs . But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS . It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas , while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors . NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1 . 3 million - strong workforce could be reshaped to help . The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting . These included : The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages , such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care , with much more stress on looking after people with long - term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them . It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff , but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened . Are nurses the new doctors ? NHS short of front - line staff , MPs say Report author Candace Imison said there were \" huge opportunities \" in reshaping the workforce , in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles . And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said : \" Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report . \" But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce , this should not be done \" at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves \" . \" It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients , and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience , \" he said . \" There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients . \" And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was \" all too often \" no funding for training courses . \" Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country , \" she added .

But although the team scored more points than any other , McLaren were kicked out of the constructors ' championship that year - and fined $ 100 m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information . There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed ' lie - gate ' - after Hamilton and sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix .

As a result , despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table , he does not expect an easy night , far from it .
